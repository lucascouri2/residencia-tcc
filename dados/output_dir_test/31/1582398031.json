In addition, 5 Cuban collaborators serving missions in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\nOn this subject, Deputy Prime Minister Roberto Morales Ojeda pointed out that \u201ctoday, before every patient, the first thing the health professional has to think about is Covid-19 and then discard it, otherwise they do not protect themselves well and get sick.\u201d\n\nPresenting the usual update of the Cuban scenario with the pandemic, Portal Miranda explained that in the country 26 local transmission events of the disease remain open, in 22 municipalities and 12 provinces. The biggest numbers are in Havana with 6; Ciego de Avila with 4; and Villa Clara, Sancti Spiritus and Holguin, with 3 each.\n\nIn particular, the Minister referred to what happened at the No.3 Nursing Home in Santa Clara city, where a group of grandparents and workers have been confirmed as positive cases.\n\nDiaz-Canel called this event the the one of greatest connotation, because of the vulnerability of senior citizens to the virus . \u201cThis must now be carried out now into care for each of these elders with precision and a differentiated attention,\u201d he said.\n\nOn this matter, Governor of Villa Clara Alberto Diaz Lopez explained the decisions made with the elderly and workers of the nursing home. The confirmed are admitted to hospitals and those who remain healthy were transferred to other sites with better conditions for isolation.
