DFB breaks its vow. Hopp remains a son of a b----,\" a banner displayed in Bayern's end read.\n\nThe referee ordered the teams into the tunnel, and some Bayern players as well as the entire club leadership walked to the stands and urged fans to take it down immediately.\n\nAfter a 20-minute interruption both teams came back onto the pitch and ran down the clock without playing competitively, ending the game with an ovation for Hopp and with Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge by the billionaire's side in a show of solidarity.\n\n\"I am deeply ashamed for the behaviour of these people. That is inexcusable. It is the ugly face of football,\" Rummenigge told reporters.\n\n\"I have apologised to Dietmar Hopp. We have filmed everything and these people will be held accountable.\"\n\nRummenigge wasn't the only person to call out fans after the games with Hoffenheim executive Peter Gorlich saying German football must show Hopp solidarity.\n\n\"A compliment to the refs, the fans and the FC Bayern players. They all realized a line was crossed and solidarity comes first. It's about one person, but in the end it's about a human being. Football Germany must show solidarity,\" Gorlich said.\n\nHowever, a German ultra described the situation to ESPN postmatch as \"all-out war.\"\n\nHoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp was backed by Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the game.

It's madness,\" Gladbach executive Max Eberl said.\n\nInformation from Reuters contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Stephan Uersfeld", "Jeff Kassouf", "Rob Dawson", "Associated Press", "Cesar Hernandez", "Sam Marsden", "Moises Llorens", "Adriana Garcia", "Dale Johnson", "Chris Wright"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Two Bundesliga games were briefly abandoned on Saturday following protests against Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://a.espncdn.com/prod/assets/icons/E.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "description": "Two Bundesliga games were briefly abandoned on Saturday following protests against Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp.", "DC.date.issued": "2020-02-29T19:02:00Z", "fb": {"app_id": 116656161708917, "pages": 104266592953439}, "og": {"site_name": "ESPN.com", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/german-bundesliga/story/4063869/bayern-dortmund-games-halted-as-fan-protests-escalate-in-bundesliga", "title": "Bayern, Dortmund games halted amid protests", "description": "Two Bundesliga games were briefly abandoned on Saturday following protests against Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp.", "image": {"identifier": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0229%2Fr673093_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 729}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"site": "espn", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/german-bundesliga/story/4063869/bayern-dortmund-games-halted-as-fan-protests-escalate-in-bundesliga", "title": "Bayern, Dortmund games halted amid protests", "description": "Two Bundesliga games were briefly abandoned on Saturday following protests against Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp.", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ESPN", "googleplay": "ESPN"}, "id": {"iphone": 317469184, "googleplay": "com.espn.score_center"}, "url": {"iphone": "sportscenter://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=4063869", "googleplay": "sportscenter://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=4063869"}}}, "title": "Bayern Dortmund games halted as fan protests escalate in Bundesliga", "medium": "article", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=317469184, app-argument=sportscenter://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=4063869"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/german-bundesliga/story/4063869/bayern-dortmund-games-halted-as-fan-protests-escalate-in-bundesliga"}
