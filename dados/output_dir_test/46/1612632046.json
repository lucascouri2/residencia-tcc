As we push forward to launching new spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) and on to the Moon and Mars, and as more commercial activities develop in space, it\u2019s important that the story of the complexity and beauty of the spacecraft continues to be told through the art of photography, so we can all better understand the mission for humanity that these spacecraft make possible.\n\nThere is a surreal nature to spaceflight. I believe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to capture the memories of it in a way that is powerful and meaningful and beautiful. Here, I offer you several images that illustrate this. Some will be very familiar while others may be less so, and I am so thankful to all of the photographers who are chronicling the magnificent beauty of spaceflight.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Spacecraft", "Space for Art"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Capturing the essence of spacecraft on film", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-param": "_csrf", "csrf-token": "LjhRYjZwaGIfaT8AZxUdM2VqOBRBBSYAQEIbVAY6Oz1oQGA0VTkqFg==", "description": "Capturing the essence of spacecraft on film", "fb": {"app_id": 1565168923714555}, "og": {"title": "Space for Art \u2013 The magnificent beauty of spaceflight - Room: The Space Journal", "type": "article", "url": "https://room.eu.com/article/space-for-art-the-magnificent-beauty-of-spaceflight", "image": {"identifier": "https://room.eu.com/images/contents/issue23-Space-Shuttle-Discovery-rolls-out-to-the-launch-pad-for-her-final-flight.png", "secure_url": "https://room.eu.com/images/contents/issue23-Space-Shuttle-Discovery-rolls-out-to-the-launch-pad-for-her-final-flight.png"}, "description": "Capturing the essence of spacecraft on film", "site_name": "Room The Space Journal of Asgardia"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Space for Art \u2013 The magnificent beauty of spaceflight - Room: The Space Journal", "site": "@Room__Space", "description": "Capturing the essence of spacecraft on film", "image": "https://room.eu.com/images/contents/issue23-Space-Shuttle-Discovery-rolls-out-to-the-launch-pad-for-her-final-flight.png"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://room.eu.com/article/space-for-art-the-magnificent-beauty-of-spaceflight"}
