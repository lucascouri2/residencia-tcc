With Trump poised to impose tariffs on steel soon that will impact European exports, Merkel said the decision is now in Trump\u2019s hands on whether to grant exemptions to European Union nations. \u201cThe president will decide. That\u2019s very clear,\u201d she said after Trump complained about the US-European trade imbalance. \u201cWe had an exchange of views. The decision lies with the president,\u201d she said. Trump said he wanted a \u201creciprocal\u201d trade relationship with Germany and other European nations and wanted Germany and other NATO allies to pay more for the common defence. \u201cWe need a reciprocal relationship, which we don\u2019t have...We\u2019re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair,\u201d Trump said. The US president also said Iran will not acquire nuclear weapons but declined comment on whether he may consider the use of force against it. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about whether or not I would use military force. But I can tell you this, they will not be doing nuclear weapons. That I can tell you. OK? They are not going to be doing nuclear weapons. You can bank on it. \u201c The leaders\u2019 last White House meeting drew attention when they did not shake hands in the Oval Office.This time round, Trump made a point of shaking Merkel\u2019s hand twice while congratulating her on her election win. \u201cWe have a really great relationship, and we actually have had a great relationship right from the beginning, but some people didn\u2019t understand that,\u201d Trump said, referring to Merkel as a \u201cvery extraordinary woman.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "fevicon/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "canonical_link": ""}
