Photo by Paulo Whitaker/EPA-EFE\n\nMay 26 (UPI) -- The Americas have surpassed Europe to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization said while calling on those countries to maintain movement restrictions to curb infections. Carissa F. Etienne, PAHO director and World Health Organization head for the Americas, said during a media briefing Tuesday that some 2.4 million infections and more than 143,000 deaths have been reported in the Americas, making it the new epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, Our World In Data, which is run out of Oxford University, calculated that Peru and Chile as having the highest seven-day average in cases per capita.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For most countries in the Americas, now is not the time to relax restrictions or scale back preventive strategies,\" she said. \"Now is the time to stay strong, remain vigilant and aggressively implement proven public health measures.\"\n\nCompounding the issue for the region of the Americans is that one in four is at risk of suffering severe effects of the virus due to underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, she said, also calling on those countries to intensify efforts to prevent them from getting sick.\n\n\"We have never seen such a deadly relationship between infectious disease and non-communicable diseases,\" she said. \"Some of the data are truly alarming. Especially for our region, where NCDs are pervasive.\"\n\nCountries should protect supply chains for essential medicines and ensure those medicines are effectively distributed to those who need them, she said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Top News", "World", "Johns Hopkins", "COVID-19"], "tags": ["COVID-19", "Johns Hopkins"], "authors": ["Darryl Coote"], "publish_date": "Wed May 27 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Americas have surpassed Europe to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization said while calling on those countries to maintain movement restrictions to curb infections.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favico.png", "meta_data": {"description": "The Americas have surpassed Europe to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization said while calling on those countries to maintain movement restrictions to curb infections.", "keywords": "Top News, World, Johns Hopkins, COVID-19", "news_keywords": "Top News, World, Johns Hopkins, COVID-19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "The Americas have surpassed Europe to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization said while calling on those countries to maintain movement restrictions to curb infections.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/05/27/PAHO-Americas-over-take-Europe-as-COVID-19-epicenter/6641590551204/", "title": "PAHO: Americas over take Europe as COVID-19 epicenter", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi_com/6641590551204/2020/1/7a585c309921d8cf4a6f8f82a5e58fe8/v1.5/PAHO-Americas-over-take-Europe-as-COVID-19-epicenter.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 802}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "title": "PAHO: Americas over take Europe as COVID-19 epicenter", "description": "The Americas have surpassed Europe to become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization said while calling on those countries to maintain movement restrictions to curb infections.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6641590551204/2020/upi_com/7a585c309921d8cf4a6f8f82a5e58fe8/v2.1/PAHO-Americas-over-take-Europe-as-COVID-19-epicenter.jpg?lg=4"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/05/27/PAHO-Americas-over-take-Europe-as-COVID-19-epicenter/6641590551204/"}
