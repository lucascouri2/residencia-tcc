But, he added, \"if tomorrow or the day after there was a reason\" to take more drastic measures, \"we would take them\".\n\nMacron said that taking \"disproportionate measures\" when France was \"only at the beginning of the crisis\" would be \"counterproductive\".\n\nThe French leader emphasised that it was \"much more effective\" to take containment measures in affected regions. Italy recorded its deadliest day of the virus outbreak on Tuesday, its toll rising by 168 to 631, with a total of 10,149 infected.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Macron", "Emmanuel", "Emmanuel Macron", "Humans", "Politicians", "Politics by country", "President", "Austria", "Slovenia", "China", "European Union", "France", "Italy"], "tags": ["BS Reads"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 11 03:46:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Slovenia and Austria had made \"bad decisions\" by severely restricting travel with neighbouring Italy.\"I sincerly believe that these are bad decisions,\" Macron said following crisis talks on the", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.business-standard.com/bsfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0", "fb": {"pages": 122094764539447, "app_id": 158662248103533}, "website": "https://www.business-standard.com", "rating": "General", "copyright": "www.business-standard.com", "author": "AFP", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Slovenia and Austria had made \"bad decisions\" by severely restricting travel with neighbouring Italy.\"I sincerly believe that these are bad decisions,\" Macron said following crisis talks on the", "keywords": "Macron,Emmanuel,Emmanuel Macron,Humans,Politicians,Politics by country,President,Austria,Slovenia,China,European Union,France,Italy", "news_keywords": "Macron, Emmanuel, Emmanuel Macron, Humans, Politicians, Politics by country, President, Austria, Slovenia, China, European Union, France, Italy", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Macron says closing borders with Italy 'a bad decision'", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/macron-says-closing-borders-with-italy-a-bad-decision-120031100062_1.html", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Slovenia and Austria had made \"bad decisions\" by severely restricting travel with neighbouring Italy.\n\"I sincerly believe that these are bad decisions,\" Macron said following crisis talks on the", "image": {"identifier": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1200311/full-120031100062.jpg", "secure_url": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1200311/full-120031100062.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 1000}}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1200311/full-120031100062.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bsindia", "creator": "@bsindia", "title": "Macron says closing borders with Italy 'a bad decision'", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Slovenia and Austria had made \"bad decisions\" by severely restricting travel with neighbouring Italy.\n\"I sincerly believe that these are bad decisions,\" Macron said following crisis talks on the", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Business Standard for iPhone", "ipad": "Business Standard"}, "url": {"iphone": "https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/business-standard-for-iphone/id581918934?mt=8", "ipad": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/business-standard/id482532990?ls=1&mt=8"}, "id": {"iphone": 581918934, "ipad": 482532990}}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-11T03:46:02+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-03-11T03:46:05+05:30", "content_tier": "free"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/macron-says-closing-borders-with-italy-a-bad-decision-120031100062_1.html"}
