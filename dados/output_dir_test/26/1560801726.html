			<p>An RCMP officer alleged to have been driving dangerously near Neepawa will not face any charges, Manitoba&rsquo;s police watchdog has concluded.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba was made aware of the incident by the RCMP on June 12, 2019, and IIU investigators interviewed three civilian witnesses and one witness officer.</p>
<p>All three witnesses saw different pieces of what they described as erratic driving by the police officer.</p>
<p>The majority of the erratic driving was observed by one civilian witness, who observed it in their rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>Another witness initially believed that weather conditions might have played a role in the erratic driving they had seen.</p>
<p>There were vague descriptions as to the duration of the erratic driving, and all three civilian witnesses were reluctant to&nbsp;go to court and testify.</p>
<p>The witness officer, who had direct contact with the other police officer, saw no signs or incidents of erratic driving during his contact with him.</p>
<p>In his report on the investigation, IIU civilian director Zane Tessler said he &ldquo;was not satisfied that there was sufficient and cogent evidence available to satisfy the necessary standard of reasonable grounds to believe an offence has occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full report is available online at iiumanitoba.ca.</p>
