From limited closures, border restrictions, to national lockdowns, most of the governments implemented varying degrees of restrictions throughout the pandemic.\n\nBy April 27th, more than a couple of months after the coronavirus first appeared in the region, all countries in Latin America had either partial or full quarantines instilled. In general, Latin American governments began their national lockdowns in mid-March before reaching its 100th confirmed case or \u201cday zero\u201d of COVID-19. Notably absent from taking any mitigation measures throughout the pandemic is Nicaragua, whose government has stressed that the novel coronavirus has not affected its country.\n\nAs of October 19th, most governments in Latin America have lifted quarantines and have opened their economies. Some are still in stages of reopening with partial quarantines in effect. Currently, Venezuela and Argentina are the only two countries in full lockdown, with President Alberto Fernandez\u2019s extending Argentina\u2019s national quarantine to October 25th. Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Honduras, and Peru have moved to partial quarantines by municipality, province, or region or by curfews or designated days/hours to circulate.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Coronavirus", "COVID-19"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Oct 19 16:04:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "How is Latin America responding to the coronavirus pandemic?
