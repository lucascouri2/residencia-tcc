In the past 10 days, the number of cases reported in Europe has nearly doubled to close to 1 million,\u201d the WHO\u2019s European director, Hans Kluge, told reporters in an online briefing.\n\nThis meant that about 50 per cent of the global burden of COVID-19 was in Europe, Kluge said. More than 84 000 people in Europe have died in the epidemic, he said.\n\n\u201cThe storm clouds of this pandemic still hang heavily over the European region,\u201d Kluge said.\n\nAs some countries start to consider whether restrictions may be eased and whether schools and some workplaces might start to reopen, he said it was critical to understand the complexity and uncertainty of such transitioning.\n\nCompanies and politicians across the world are worried about the economic impact of a long shutdown, and some countries in Europe \u2013 such as Germany, Denmark, Spain and others \u2013 are beginning to think about how to ease some societal restrictions.\n\nKluge said the WHO recognised that social distancing policies designed to slow the spread of the virus \u201care affecting lives and livelihoods\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople are rightly asking: How much do we have to endure? And for how long? In response, we, governments, and health authorities must come up with answers to identify when, under what conditions and how we can consider a safe transition.\u201d\n\nAny step to lift lockdown measures must firstly ensure several key things, he said, including that evidence shows a country\u2019s COVID-19 transmission is being controlled, outbreak risks are minimised, and that health systems have the capacity to identify, test, trace and isolate COVID-19 cases.\n\n\u201cWe remain in the eye of the storm . . . . If you cannot ensure these criteria are in place before easing restrictions, I urge you to re-think,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is no fast track back to normal.\u201d (Reuters)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Article By"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 14:50:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/favicons.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 270969375988}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/favicons.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "WHO European director urges caution on easing lockdowns", "description": "LONDON \u2013 Europe is in the eye of the storm of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million, and should move with extreme caution when considering easing lockdowns, the World Health Organisation\u2019s regional director said on Thursday.\u201cCase numbers across the region continue to climb.
