Kumgang, and mentioned border cooperation without elaborating. He added the joint 2032 Olympics bid would be a unifying event, as would completing the inter-Korean railroad.\n\n\u201cWe want to make an era where separation is no longer a roadblock for peace and prosperity for South and North Korea,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Korea has been unresponsive to other recent overtures from Seoul, and cooperation projects between the neighbours have stalled in the face of international sanctions that bar most business with the North.\n\nPyongyang has expressed frustration at what it calls Washington\u2019s lack of flexibility, while U.S. officials say it must take more concrete steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes before sanctions are eased.\n\n\u201cThe momentum for U.S.-North Korea talks must continue,\u201d Moon said. \u201cProvocations and threats are not helpful for anyone.\u201d\n\nOver the New Year, Kim said he planned to further develop nuclear programmes and introduce a \u201cnew strategic weapon\u201d in the near future, though he signalled there was still room for dialogue with the United States.\n\nSecurity and prosperity on the Korean peninsula are dependent on resolving international tensions, but the two Koreas could achieve progress through cooperation, Moon said. \u201cI suggest South and North Korea put our heads together,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["World"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Jan  7 21:00:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "There is a \"desperate need\" for practical ways to improve ties with North Korea, the South's President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday, adding", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2020/08/app-icon-192x192-1.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "There is a \"desperate need\" for practical ways to improve ties with North Korea, the South's President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday, adding", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "South Korea\u2019s Moon cites \u2018desperate need\u2019 for ways to improve ties with", "description": "There is a \"desperate need\" for practical ways to improve ties with North Korea, the South's President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday, adding", "url": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/535086/south-koreas-moon-cites-desperate-need-for-ways-to-improve-ties-with-north/", "site_name": "Daily Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2020/01/07/South-Koreas-Moon-cites-desperate-need-for-ways-to-improve-ties-with-North.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 446}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytimespak", "published_time": "2020-01-07T21:00:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-07T21:00:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dailytimespak", "site": "@dailytimespak"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#D5E0EB", "google-site-verification": "OCRTS754JMxwghEzzchZDigcFsr1BA1g4gztRRYiCjs", "msvalidate.01": "7F7A94B66284996C319B6CD24FB6241E", "fb": {"pages": 710854355609434, "app_id": 2292619501058101}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "pwaforwp": "wordpress-plugin", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Times", "application-name": "Daily Times", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES"}, "canonical_link": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/535086/south-koreas-moon-cites-desperate-need-for-ways-to-improve-ties-with-north/"}
