The army, the legislative branch of government and the cabinet of ministers themselves have also been involved in this tug-of-war.\n\nThe uncertainty and lack of confidence in the government that this has produced has been such that organized crime in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro has arrogated to itself the right to impose a curfew as a health measure.\n\nOn the part of the cabinet of ministers, the main resistance that Bolsonaro had encountered came precisely from his Minister of Health, Henrique Mandetta, who from the beginning was in favor of quarantines and social distancing as containment measures.\n\nWhile Bolsonaro continued to call his followers to large mobilizations and insisted that the country should continue working and could not stop, Mandetta held daily press conferences explaining how to contain the epidemic based on the scientists' recommendations.\n\nThis made the relationship between the president and the minister tense and deteriorating, to the point that Mandetta even stated in early April that he would only leave his post if he was removed by the president, because Brazil was the patient he had been entrusted with and a doctor does not abandon his patient.\n\nIf Mandetta resisted in his position from February until yesterday it was because he had the support of the military, who took away his backing after Mandetta declared in a TV Globo interview that he hoped that he and the president could have a clear and unified discourse. This was interpreted by the armed forces as insubordination.\n\nAt two in the afternoon Mandetta announced on his Twitter account that he had been dismissed by the president.\n\nThe announcement was followed by a chorus of pots and pans and shouts of \"Out Bolsonaro\" and the immediate inauguration of oncologist Nelson Teich as Brazil's new Minister of Health. During the same ceremony, Bolsonaro announced that he and the new minister were planning how to reopen the country and lift the quarantines imposed by the governors throughout the country.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bolsonaro removes his health minister to end social distancing in Brazil"], "tags": [], "authors": ["April"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Former Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Mandetta announced on Twitter that he had been dismissed.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/themes/custom/al_dia_news/assets/img/favicon-aldianews.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Former Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Mandetta announced on Twitter that he had been dismissed.", "abstract": "THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN LATINO EXPERIENCE", "keywords": "Bolsonaro removes his health minister to end social distancing in Brazil", "fb": {"pages": "ALDIANews"}, "og": {"determiner": "Automatic", "site_name": "Al D\u00eda News", "type": "News", "url": "https://aldianews.com/en/politics/policy/bolsonaro-against-mandetta", "title": "Bolsonaro removes his health minister to end social distancing in Brazil", "description": "Former Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Mandetta announced on Twitter that he had been dismissed.", "image": {"identifier": "https://aldianews.comdurante la rueda de prensa del 14 de abril.
