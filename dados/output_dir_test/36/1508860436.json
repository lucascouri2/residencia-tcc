True to his bombastic style, he called it the \u201cdeal of the century\". It includes the proposal of a future Palestinian state, but also seems to let Israel retain control of Jerusalem as its capital and also of annexed territories in the West Bank where Jewish settlements have been built. It\u2019s no surprise that the deal was swiftly rejected by Palestinian leaders.\n\nMaybe it was just a political game. Trump, who is suspected of letting his son-in-law Jared Kushner determine White House policy in the region, is undergoing an impeachment trial in Washington DC. Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom Trump shared many a photo op, is in legal trouble for corruption. Netayanhu is also in campaign mode\u2014for a third election after two earlier ones failed to deliver a verdict in any Israeli party\u2019s favour. The proposal seems aimed at the two leaders\u2019 respective constituencies.\n\nFor decades, Palestinians have been sceptical of the US being an even-handed mediator in the conflict. Trump, though, doesn\u2019t even bother to disguise a pro-Israel tilt. Kushner, meanwhile, has been leading efforts that effectively seek to have big money buy out Palestinian claims. Given the smouldering history of the stand-off and religious sensitivities over the status of Jerusalem\u2014especially the site of the Al Aqsa mosque and Western Wall\u2014a cavalier approach would not work. If the US truly wants the issue resolved, it needs buy-in from both sides, and that takes real effort.\n\nTopics", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald Trump", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Jared Kushner"], "tags": ["Digital Gurus", "Money With Monika", "SME", "5G Tech", "Long Story Capsule", "Annual Banking Conclave", "India Investment Summit", "Brand Masters", "Budget Videos", "Mint Views", "Mint SnapView", "Mint 50 - Top Mutual Funds", "Market Analysis", "Mint Explainers", "Start-Up Diaries", "Plain Facts", "Long Story", "Coronavirus", "Why Not Mint Money", "Mint Insight", "Primer", "Foldable Smartphones", "Business of Entertainment"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 29 16:59:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Trump, who is suspected of letting his son-in-law Jared Kushner determine White House policy in the region, is undergoing an impeachment trial in Washington DC", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.livemint.com/icons/mintfavi.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "EwQFATcR7wbTZdv5oERLKcEEss7qLvsi494nTO6F-oA", "fb": {"pages": 1395893943962978}, "description": "Trump, who is suspected of letting his son-in-law Jared Kushner determine White House policy in the region, is undergoing an impeachment trial in Washington DC", "keywords": "Donald Trump,Benjamin Netanyahu,Jared Kushner", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Benjamin Netanyahu,Jared Kushner", "og": {"title": "Trump\u2019s DOA peace plan", "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/01/29/600x338/2019-12-19T021440Z_1_LYNXMPEFBI05F_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMPEACHMENT-RALLY_1576722962702_1580297257210.JPG", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/trump-s-doa-peace-plan-11580297215420.html", "site_name": "mint", "description": "Trump, who is suspected of letting his son-in-law Jared Kushner determine White House policy in the region, is undergoing an impeachment trial in Washington DC"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Trump\u2019s DOA peace plan", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@mint", "creator": "@mint", "domain": "livemint.com", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/trump-s-doa-peace-plan-11580297215420.html", "title": "Trump\u2019s DOA peace plan", "description": "Trump, who is suspected of letting his son-in-law Jared Kushner determine White House policy in the region, is undergoing an impeachment trial in Washington DC", "image": {"src": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/01/29/600x338/2019-12-19T021440Z_1_LYNXMPEFBI05F_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMPEACHMENT-RALLY_1576722962702_1580297257210.JPG"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-29T16:59:46+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-29T16:59:47+05:30", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Donald Trump"}, "author": "Livemint", "Last-Modified": "2020-01-29T16:59:47+05:30", "Last-Modified-Date": "Wed, Jan 29, 2020", "Last-Modified-Time": "2020-01-29T16:59:47+05:30", "storyid": 11580297215420, "section": "Opinion", "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "story"}, "screen-name": "story"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/trump-s-doa-peace-plan-11580297215420.html"}
