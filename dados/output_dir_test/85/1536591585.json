Therefore, each nation needs to act more promptly to prevent risks of new outbreaks.WWF Vietnam Director Van Ngoc Thinh said WWF offices in the Asia-Pacific has welcomed the decision to ban the consumption of wild animal meat and unregulated wildlife trade made by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China \u2013 the highest law-making body of that country.They have also called on other East Asian nations to make similar decisions to protect people\u2019s health and life, he said, noting that Southeast Asia is still known as a source and a transit point of wildlife products for China.WWF offices in the Asia-Pacific has urged government agencies to be responsible for wildlife conservation and management and for public health in their countries, join hands to boost market monitoring and communications, and eradicate the trade and consumption of wild animal meat and wildlife products.Thinh said Vietnam needs similar drastic actions, adding that people\u2019s health, economic stability, national credit rating and social security must come first./.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["World Wide Fund for Nature", "WWF", "wildlife trade and consumption", "Asia-Pacific", "COVID-19", "wildlife products", "wildlife conservation", "updated Vietnam news", "Vietnamplus", "Vietnam News Agency"], "tags": ["Post-pandemic recovery", "wildlife trade and consumption", "Asia-Pacific", "wildlife products", "COVID-19", "wildlife conservation", "East Sea", "Party Building", "Vietnam News Agency", "Human rights", "World Wide Fund for Nature", "Digital transformation", "updated Vietnam news", "Climate Change", "Vietnamplus", "WWF"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 21:12:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has appealed for an end to the wildlife trade and consumption across the Asia-Pacific region amid the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and similar diseases in recent years.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "World Wide Fund for Nature, WWF, wildlife trade and consumption, Asia-Pacific, COVID-19, wildlife products, wildlife conservation, updated Vietnam news, Vietnamplus, Vietnam News Agency", "description": "The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has appealed for an end to the wildlife trade and consumption across the Asia-Pacific region amid the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and similar diseases in recent years.", "author": "VietnamPlus", "robots": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow,archive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 120834779440, "app_id": 1960985707489919}, "og": {"site_name": "VietnamPlus", "rich_attachment": "true", "type": "article", "title": "WWF urges end to wildlife trade, consumption in Asia-Pacific | Environment | Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus)", "description": "The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has appealed for an end to the wildlife trade and consumption across the Asia-Pacific region amid the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and similar diseases in recent years.", "url": "https://en.vietnamplus.vn/wwf-urges-end-to-wildlife-trade-consumption-in-asiapacific/169498.vnp", "image": {"url": "https://cdnimgen.vietnamplus.vn/t460/Uploaded/wbxx/2020_03_02/end_to_wildlife_trade.jpg", "width": 460, "height": 345}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/VietnamPlus", "published_time": "2020-03-02T21:12:00+07:00", "section": "Environment", "tag": "Vietnam News Agency"}, "yandex-verification": "46ffdbcd03890329"}, "canonical_link": "https://en.vietnamplus.vn%2fwwf-urges-end-to-wildlife-trade-consumption-in-asiapacific%2f169498.vnp"}
