If it did happen, it was surely not an offer to Assange to lie\", Former UN Independent Expert Alfred de Zayas believes. \"Assange would not have needed to lie, because the evidence indicates that the DNC leaks did not come from Russian hackers. Assange himself said that the source was NOT the Russian government,\" he said.\n\nWhite House denied on Wednesday allegations that President Donald Trump directed former Congressman Dana Rohrabacher to offer WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a pardon if he said Russia had no role in the DNC leaks.\n\n\"I do not like the talk of giving 'pardon' - because that implies that there has been a trial and a conviction. I do not think that Assange has committed any crime,\" de Zayas says. \"He is the victim of arbitrariness, irregularities, misuse of the administration of justice systems in the US, UK, Sweden and Ecuador. He is a victim of multiple crimes, including psychological torture, as documented by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Professor Nils Melzer.\"\n\nAssange's Case\n\nJulian Assange was indicted on 18 charges in the United States, mostly espionage after he leaked classified documents revealing war crimes committed by US-led forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["opinion", "julian assange", "russia"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sputnik International"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 20 04:12:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Westminster Magistrates' Court heard on Wednesday that evidence will be submitted in the extradition case of Julian Assange pertaining to an alleged... 20.02.2020, Sputnik International", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/i/favicon/favicon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "The Westminster Magistrates' Court heard on Wednesday that evidence will be submitted in the extradition case of Julian Assange pertaining to an alleged... 20.02.2020, Sputnik International", "keywords": "opinion, julian assange, russia", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "referrer": "always", "format-detection": "address=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/i/favicon/favicon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#F4F4F4", "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "analytics": {"lang": "eng", "title": "'If It Did Happen, It Was Surely Not an Offer to Assange to Lie' - Rapporteur on Alleged 'Pardon Offer'", "keyw": "analysis, tag_JulianAssange, keyword_Democrats, keyword_investigative_journalism, keyword_opinion, geo_Russia, keyword_conspiracy, keyword_WikiLeaks", "tags": "Opinion, Julian Assange, Democrats, investigative journalism, opinion, Russia, conspiracy, WikiLeaks", "site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1078356699, "url": "https://sputniknews.com/20200220/if-it-did-happen-it-was-not-an-offer-to-assange-to-lie---un-expert-on-alleged-pardon-offer-1078356699.html", "p_ts": 1582171966, "author": "Sputnik International", "isscroll": 0}, "og": {"url": "https://sputniknews.com/20200220/if-it-did-happen-it-was-not-an-offer-to-assange-to-lie---un-expert-on-alleged-pardon-offer-1078356699.html", "title": "'If It Did Happen, It Was Not an Offer to Assange to Lie' - UN Expert on Alleged 'Pardon Offer'", "description": "The Westminster Magistrates' Court heard on Wednesday that evidence will be submitted in the extradition case of Julian Assange pertaining to an alleged \"pardon offer\" made by Donald Trump to the WikiLeaks founder, triggering speculations...", "type": "article", "site_name": "Sputnik International", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1078356699.png?1582172900"}, "relap-image": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/i/logo/logo-social.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1078356699.png?1582172900"}, "article": {"published_time": "20200220T0412+0000", "modified_time": "20200220T0428+0000", "author": "Sputnik International", "section": "News", "tag": "Russia"}, "relap-entity-id": 1078356699}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/20200220/if-it-did-happen-it-was-not-an-offer-to-assange-to-lie---un-expert-on-alleged-pardon-offer-1078356699.html"}
