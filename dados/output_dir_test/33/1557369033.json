outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 The IOC announced a first-of-its-kind postponement of the Summer Olympics on Tuesday, bowing to the realities of a coronavirus pandemic that is shutting down daily life around the globe and making planning for a massive worldwide gathering in July a virtual impossibility.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said the Tokyo Games \u201cmust be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.\u201d\n\nIt was an announcement seen as all but a certainty as pressure mounted from nervous athletes, sports organizations and national Olympic committees \u2014 all confronting the reality that training and qualifying schedules, to say nothing of international anti-doping protocols, had been ruptured beyond repair.\n\nFour-time Olympic hockey champion Hayley Wickenheiser, the first IOC member to criticize the body\u2019s reluctance to postpone, called it the \u201cmessage athletes deserved to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all the athletes: take a breath, regroup, take care of yourself and your families. Your time will come,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach and Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo met via phone Tuesday morning, and they, along with a handful of executives from the IOC and Japan\u2019s organizing committee, agreed to make the call.\n\nOther Olympics \u2014 1916, 1940 and 1944 \u2014 have been canceled because of war, but none have ever been postponed for any reason, let alone a renegade virus that has accounted for more than 375,000 cases worldwide, with numbers growing exponentially. The Tokyo Games would still be called the 2020 Olympics, even though they will be held in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope,\u201d the IOC said in a statement.\n\nThe decision offers a sense of relief for athletes, who no longer have to press forward with training under near-impossible conditions, unsure of when, exactly, they need to be ready \u2014 and for what.\n\n\u201cThankful to finally have some clarity regarding The Olympic Games. A huge decision but I think the right one for sure,\u201d British sprinter Adam Gemili said on Twitter. \u201cTime to regain, look after each other during this difficult period and go again when the time is right!\u201d\n\nOne reason the IOC took longer to make the decision was because it wanted to figure out logistics. It will be a daunting challenge. Many of the arenas, stadiums and hotels are under contract for a games held from July 24-August 7. Remaking those arrangements is doable, but will come at a cost. Tokyo has already spent a reported $28 billion to stage the games.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the international sports schedule. Virtually all 33 sports on the Olympic program have key events, including world championships, on the docket for 2021. Perhaps the best example of what a disruption this can cause would come from track. Famous Hayward Field at University of Oregon was rebuild and expanded at the cost of $200 million to hold next year\u2019s world championships. Now that event could be postponed, canceled or see its stature greatly diminished if its run within months of a rescheduled Olympics.\n\n\u201cA lot can happen in one year, so we have to think about what we have to do,\u201d said Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organizing committee. \u201cThe decision came upon us all of a sudden.\u201d\n\nBut for weeks, it was becoming increasingly clear that pressing on with a July 24 starting date was no longer a choice.\n\nVirtually every sport across the globe has suspended play in the wake of the pandemic. The worldwide economy is faltering and people are increasingly being told it\u2019s not safe to congregate in large groups or, in some cases, even to leave their houses. Gyms are closed across America. Holding Olympic trials in a matter of months was becoming a virtual impossibility.\n\nOlympic committees in Canada and Australia were saying they either would not, or could not, send a team to Tokyo in July. World Athletics and the three biggest sports in the United States \u2014 swimming, track and gymnastics \u2014 were calling for a postponement.\n\nAs recently as Sunday, the IOC was saying it would take up to four weeks to reach a decision. Four weeks ended up being two days.\n\nThe decision came only a few hours after local organizers said the torch relay would start as planned on Thursday. It was expected to start in northeastern Fukushima prefecture, but with no torch, no torchbearers and no public.\n\nThose plans also changed.\n\nThe flame will be stored and displayed in Fukushima. Like everything else in the Olympic world, it\u2019s next move will be determined at a later date.\n\nStatement from an NBC Sports spokesperson on postponement of 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics: \u201cGiven the unprecedented obligation we all face to contain COVID-19 globally, we fully understand the decision made by the IOC, Japanese government, and the health organizations they are working with to postpone the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics until 2021. We have no doubt that the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee will put on an exceptional Games next year, and that the Olympic flame will once again unite the world and provide a light at the end of this tunnel.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ohio News", "Cleveland Guardians", "Cleveland Cavaliers", "Missing", "Your Local Election Headquarters", "Mega Millions", "Cleveland Browns", "FOX 8 I-Team"], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 24 11:52:42 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 The IOC announced a first-of-its-kind postponement of the Summer Olympics on Tuesday, bowing to the realities of a coronavirus pandemic that is shutting down daily life around the globe and making planning for a massive worldwide gathering in July a virtual impossibility.
