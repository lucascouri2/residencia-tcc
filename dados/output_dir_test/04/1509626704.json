All Classified National Security.\"\n\nDespite the formal review process of Bolton's book, drafts have already circulated around Washington, where the passages describing Trump's relationship with Ukraine caused a sensation.\n\nAt a news conference in Davos last week, Trump indicated he was worried about Bolton, whom he fired in 2019.\n\nTrump said the veteran foreign policy adviser \"knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive?\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["World", "Agence France Presse"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Naharnet is the leading Lebanese news destination, breaking the news as it happens!", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msvalidate.01": "B131F13C3059E39D4DD66E218700E9E4", "google-site-verification": "nUAwBOBRdI8gnFlNy87WgDS4_n6b6i5YfUfczTq2DJQ", "description": "Naharnet is the leading Lebanese news destination, breaking the news as it happens!", "og": {"site_name": "Naharnet", "title": "White House Bars Bolton Book Release over 'Top Secret' Material", "description": "The White House told former national security adviser John Bolton that a book reportedly containing damaging evidence for President Donald Trump cannot be published because it breaks secrecy laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warning was made in a letter to...", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/268655", "image": "http://images2.naharnet.com/images/223255/w140.jpg?1561447031"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "5NMknEaFTreNKPV4JXLIgz/Omf+MGRGhZ4M2DBZBoyc="}, "canonical_link": "http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/268655"}
