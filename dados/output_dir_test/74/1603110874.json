Ron DeSantis has expressed his desire to see the new 5-minute Coronavirus detection test \u201cintegrated \"with international travel into the United States.\n\nGov. DeSantis made the remark during a press conference to discuss the U.S. Army Corps Of Engineer\u2019s construction of a 250,000 square foot, COVID-19-only field hospital inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, which the governor says should be up and running by April 30th.\n\n\u201cObviously, we have people coming from all over the world, all the time,\u201d said DeSantis \u201cI would like to see these rapid tests integrated with some of the international travel. If you are coming from like a Brazil or these other places, it would be good to have those tests available and done so that as people come to Florida, we know that people aren\u2019t necessarily carrying the virus.\u201d\n\nDeSantis continued, expressing his frustration and concern that all of the gains Florida has made and stands to make in mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 virus will be for not if travelers, both foreign and domestic, are allowed to enter the state unchecked. He says \u201cit\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going through a lot here. Miami has gone through a lot here. Other parts of Florida have gone through a lot here. We\u2019ve had a lot of dislocation economically. We are trying to mitigate that. We\u2019re are trying to bounce back from it, but to go through all that and then just have people coming internationally or even domestically and ceding it all over again, I think is a problem.\u201d- Gov. Ron DeSantis\n\nPresident Trump\n\nDeSantis, who has been in close contact with President Donald Trump during the pandemic, said that we will discuss travel options for Florida.\n\n\u201cI am going to talk to the president about this. The fact of the matter is, airplanes are what brought the virus to the United States, and so we have to think smart about this.\n\nBut I think we want to have people to be able to function as a society. The travel is something we are really going to have to build in some protections for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to plan for worse case,\u201d said DeSantis, adding that \u201cabsent a major change, capacity is there.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Javier Manjarres Is A Nationally Renowned Award-Winning Political Journalist", "Publisher Of Floridianpress.Com", "Hispolitica.Com", "Shark-Tank.Com", "Texaspolitics.Com He Enjoys Traveling", "Playing Soccer", "Mixed Martial Arts", "Weight-Lifting", "Swimming", "Biking."], "publish_date": "Wed Apr  8 20:18:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Miami Beach \u2013 Gov.
