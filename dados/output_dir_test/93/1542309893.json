The river, known as Meri\u00e7 in Turkey, forms the natural border between both countries.\n\nThe video was captured by Turkish state broadcaster TRT. CNN cannot independently verify this specific video or circumstances surrounding how it was shot. But human rights groups like Amnesty International have documented dozens of similar refugee testimonies in recent years \u2014 which Greek authorities have repeatedly denied.CNN has spoken to several men from Syria, Afghanistan, Morocco and Pakistan who said they experienced this violent and degrading treatment by the Greek security forces in recent days.\n\nMore at CNN", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Mar  8 12:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://michaelsavage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-512.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "-xgquAEC8qbWJF6wtLixFr9FNS1p4Thh8Laq8SaTouQ", "msvalidate.01": "E72664D5AA548BF8674F829733DAEEEB", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Migrants say Greek forces stripped them and sent them back to Turkey in their underwear \u22c6 The Savage Nation", "description": "CNN: Several migrants attempting to cross from Turkey to Greece told CNN over the past week that Greek security forces [READ MORE]", "url": "https://michaelsavage.com/migrants-say-greek-forces-stripped-them-and-sent-them-back-to-turkey-in-their-underwear/", "site_name": "The Savage Nation", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/michaelsavage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-08-at-8.16.14-AM.png?fit=778%2C490&ssl=1", "width": 778, "height": 490, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/drmichaelsavage", "published_time": "2020-03-08T12:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-08T15:23:09+00:00"}, "author": "Helen", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@helenfromsun", "site": "@ASavageNation", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Helen", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "Give v2.23.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/michaelsavage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-star-512.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://michaelsavage.com/migrants-say-greek-forces-stripped-them-and-sent-them-back-to-turkey-in-their-underwear/"}
