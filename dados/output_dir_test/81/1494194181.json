The timing of the operation suggests, however, that the Russian agents could be searching for material that could damage the Bidens.\n\nThe House of Representatives impeached Trump in December for abusing the power of his office by enlisting the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden, a political rival, ahead of the 2020 election. A second charge accused Trump of obstructing a congressional investigation into the matter.\n\nArea 1 CEO Oren Falkowitz is a former National Security Agency employee. His company\u2019s clients include candidates for U.S. federal elected offices. In an interview Friday, he told The Associated Press that top candidates for the U.S. presidency and House and Senate races in 2020 have in the past few months each been targeted by about one thousand phishing emails.\n\nFalkowitz did not name the candidates. Nor would he name any clients.\n\nRussian hackers from the same military intelligence unit that Area 1 said was behind the operation targeting Burisma have been indicted for hacking emails from the Democratic National Committee and the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nStolen emails were released online at the time by Russian agents and WikiLeaks in an effort to favor Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller determined in his investigation.\n\nArea 1 discovered the phishing campaign by the Russian military intelligence unit, known as the GRU, on New Year\u2019s Eve, Falkowitz said via e-mail.\n\nIn the report, he said the GRU agents used fake, lookalike domains in the phishing campaign designed to mimic real Burisma subsidiaries.\n\nThe cybersecurity researchers said the operation targeting Burisma used tactics, techniques and procedures that GRU agents had used repeatedly in other phishing operations. Area 1 says it has been tracking the Russian agents for several years.\n\nPhished credentials allow attackers both to rifle through a victim\u2019s stored email and masquerade as that person.\n\nArea 1 said its researchers connected the phishing campaign targeting Burisma to another that targeted a media organization founded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nIn phishing, an attacker uses a targeted email to lure a target to a fake site that resembles a familiar one. There, unwitting victims enter their usernames and passwords, which the hackers then harvest.\n\nIn this case, the Russian military agents, from a group security researchers call \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d peppered Burisma employees with emails designed to look like internal messages.\n\nIn order to detect phishing attacks, Area 1 maintains a global network of sensors designed to sniff out and block them before they reach their targets.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Federal Elections Commission gave Area 1 permission to offer its services to candidates for federal elected office and political committees at the same low rates it charges non-profits.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Gary Martin", "Arthur Kane", "David Wilson", "Taylor R.
