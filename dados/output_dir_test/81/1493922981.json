Then, government upset. Now, Puerto Rico is facing the effects of devastating earthquakesA colourful and boisterous place in normal times, Gu\u00e1nica today presents a ghostly and deserted air, the sea breeze whistling through the ruins of the collapsed buildings that dot its streets.The signs of life are a few: stray cats and dogs and a handful of families furtively piling their belongings into vehicles as they evacuate their homes.The town sits near the epicentre of the 6.4 earthquake that rocked Puerto Rico on Tuesday \u2013 the worst tremor to hit Puerto Rico in a century \u2013 which killed at least three people and left thousands homeless. Large-scale aftershocks, including one of 6.0 magnitude on Saturday morning, have rocked the island ever since.\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like this,\u201d said Edith Mu\u00f1iz, 55, a lifelong resident of the town.\u201cMany have fled their homes,\u201d Mu\u00f1iz said, standing in front of a Presbyterian church where emergency supplies were being collected. Across the street lay the ruins of a school whose three floors had pancaked flat on one another. (Luckily, the students were still off on winter break.) \u201cWe\u2019re living here without water and without light.\u201dThe quakes are the latest in a string of shocks for this island of 3.2 million people \u2013 a commonwealth of the United States whose residents are US citizens but cannot vote in US presidential elections and have no voting representation in the US Congress. The island is still reeling from the impact of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria \u2013 which devastated the island and killed at least 3,000 people \u2013 and processing protests last summer which forced the then governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, from office.As after Maria, the response of the US government has appeared unfocused and disconnected. And \u2013 as after Maria \u2013 local officials have given varying and contradictory information about the island\u2019s power grid. On Satuday, at least 20% of the island\u2019s customers were still without power.After this latest tragedy, many in Puerto Rico wonder if the powers that lord over them \u2013 local or federal \u2013 have learned anything from recent history.\u201cThe root of the problem remains unchanged,\u201d saids Manuel Natal Albelo, 33, a representative in the commonwealth\u2019s House of Representatives who will be running for mayor of the capital San Juan this fall under the banner of the Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana (MVC), an insurgent political party formed shortly before this past summer\u2019s protests.\u201cIt is the corruption of a two-party system that responds exclusively to benefit particular financial interest groups,\u201d Natal continued. \u201cFrom the policies to the individuals in charge of their implementation, the old political establishment still sacrifices the vast majority of our people to protect the privileges of a few.\u201dRossell\u00f3 eventually resigned after a series of profane chats were leaked in which he and close advisers mocked ordinary Puerto Ricans. His hand-picked successor, Pedro Pierluisi, lasted just five days before the island\u2019s supreme court forced him out, citing questionable terms of succession.Pierluisi was succeeded by Wanda V\u00e1zquez, the island\u2019s justice secretary. She claimed no political aspirations herself, but quickly warmed to the role, announcing last month that she would run for a full term in office, in the primaries of the ruling Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), which favours Puerto Rico becoming a US state.The PNP dominates the island\u2019s bicameral legislature, while the opposition Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico (PPD) \u2013 which favours a continuation of commonwealth status \u2013 maintains a slim majority of the mayor\u2019s office.
