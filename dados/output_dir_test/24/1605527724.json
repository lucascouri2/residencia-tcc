It can be done Fast & Safely!\" Trump said in a tweet.\n\nMusk said Monday the company was resuming production, defying authorities and escalating a feud over the Pacific state\u00b4s pandemic shutdown. \"I will be on the line with everyone else,\" Musk tweeted. \"If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.\"\n\nMusk\u00b4s move comes amid rising disputes over the pace of easing the lockdowns imposed by states to contain the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Over the weekend, Musk threatened to move Tesla\u00b4s headquarters and factory out of California as a result of the standoff.\n\nFollowing Musk\u00b4s\n\nstatement, Alameda County\u00b4s office of emergency services said Tesla was only allowed to maintain \"minimum basic operations\" until officials approve a plan.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump sided with Tesla on Tuesday, calling for California authorities to allow the reopening of the electric carmaker\u00b4s assembly plant after company chief Elon...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "Trump backs Tesla on reopening after Musk defies order | World | thenews.com.pk", "description": "WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump sided with Tesla on Tuesday, calling for California authorities to allow the reopening of the electric carmaker\u00b4s assembly plant after company chief Elon...", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "Trump backs Tesla on reopening after Musk defies order", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 400}, "description": "WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump sided with Tesla on Tuesday, calling for California authorities to allow the reopening of the electric carmaker\u00b4s assembly plant after company chief Elon...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/658130-trump-backs-tesla-on-reopening-after-musk-defies-order", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@AFP", "title": "Trump backs Tesla on reopening after Musk defies order", "description": "WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump sided with Tesla on Tuesday, calling for California authorities to allow the reopening of the electric carmaker\u00b4s assembly plant after company chief Elon...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/658130-trump-backs-tesla-on-reopening-after-musk-defies-order"}
