The number of deaths has a disproportionate number of Latinos and African Americans who are falling and this has to do with the jobs they have in the United States and more than anything in New York: on the front line, like nurses, doctors, those who take the buses and the trains. This was to pay homage to all these people,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said from a spot at which the unfinished portrait looks like a blue lake on the asphalt.\n\nRodr\u00edguez says that he likes to play with \u201chow we see the world from above,\u201d how we look at reality through applications such as Google Earth or Google Maps, and that he would like this work to be picked up by these eyes from the air \u201cso that everyone can see it.\u201d\n\nThe art piece, like many of his works, will not last forever on the asphalt of the parking lot, but all possible images of it are collected so that it is not lost in time or forgotten, like so many names, efforts and heroes in the coronavirus crisis.\n\nSOMOS, a health care organization made up mostly of descendants of immigrants, two thirds of them Latin Americans, has collaborated with the NGO Make the Road and the El Barrio museum to carry out this project.\n\nRodr\u00edguez only needs to complete the eyes to see the entire face of Decoo, with his blue cap and mask, just like those worn today by the artist and many New Yorkers to prevent the virus from stealing more lives.
