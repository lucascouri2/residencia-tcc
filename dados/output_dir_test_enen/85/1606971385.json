Initially, Chrome is setting restriction thresholds to 4MB of network data or 14 seconds of CPU usage in a 30-second period. Alternatively, ads will be limited after 60 seconds of total CPU usage.\n\nAn ad frame will be redirected to an error page if it reaches one of the above thresholds, with the page informing users that said ad used too many resources and was therefore removed from active display.\n\nAccording to in-house measurements, only 0.3% of current ads exceed the stipulated thresholds. Still, those ads account for 27% of network data used and 28% of all ad CPU usage on Chrome. The figures underscore the need for intervention.\n\nAd creators can view Chrome's access reports to see which ads were unloaded due to the new restrictions and make necessary adjustments.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Apple", "Apple Inc", "iPhone", "iPad", "iPod touch", "iPod nano", "Apple TV", "Apple", "iPod shuffle", "iphone 6", "iphone 6s", "ios 9", "ios9", "iTunes", "i mac", "mac os x", "mac osx", "Apple Computer", "Apple Computer Inc.", "Mac OS X", "iMac", "iBook", "Mac Pro", "MacBook Pro", "Magic Pad", "Magic Mouse", "iPod classic", "App Store", "iTunes Store", "iBook Store", "mac book", "Microsoft", "Adobe", "Research in Motion", "RIM", "Nokia", "Samsung", "Google", "Nvidia", "Intel"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/v9/images/apple-touch-icon-57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.", "keywords": "Apple, Apple Inc, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, iPod nano, Apple TV, Apple, iPod shuffle, iphone 6, iphone 6s, ios 9, ios9, iTunes, i mac, mac os x, mac osx, Apple Computer, Apple Computer Inc., Mac OS X, iMac, iBook, Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, Magic Pad, Magic Mouse, iPod classic, App Store, iTunes Store, iBook Store, mac book, Microsoft, Adobe, Research in Motion, RIM, Nokia, Samsung, Google, Nvidia, Intel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "google-site-verification": "p84Cqvyr9UB11ipMY8Bmt_X7K69Ay95_1EQ_BwRgU1c", "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"pages": 135590163123753, "app_id": 908219582587578}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "AppleInsider", "og": {"url": "https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/15/chrome-to-limit-resource-hog-ads-by-august", "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/35813-66025-200514-Chrome-xl.jpg", "title": "Chrome to limit resource hog ads by August", "description": "Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.", "type": "website", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "AppleInsider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@appleinsider", "creator": "@appleinsider", "domain": "appleinsider.com", "title": "Chrome to limit resource hog ads by August", "description": "Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.", "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/35813-66025-200514-Chrome-xl.jpg", "url": "https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/15/chrome-to-limit-resource-hog-ads-by-august"}}, "canonical_link": "https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/15/chrome-to-limit-resource-hog-ads-by-august"}
