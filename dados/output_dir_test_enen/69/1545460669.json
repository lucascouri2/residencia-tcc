Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., vowed to challenge former Vice President Joe Biden on key issues at the upcoming Democratic primary debate as he rejected calls to drop out of the race following a disappointing finish on mini-Super Tuesday.\n\nSanders told supporters in his home state that he planned to stay in the race and was eager to spar with the front-runner at Sunday\u2019s debate in Phoenix.\n\n\u201cLast night was obviously not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat became even more apparent yesterday is that while we are currently losing the delegate count . . . we are strongly winning in two enormously important areas, which will determine the future of our country. Poll after poll shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda.\u201d\n\nNumerous exit polls from Tuesday\u2019s races found that a majority of primary voters backed policies like Medicare for All, even in states which backed Biden.\n\n\u201cThe American people are deeply concerned about the grotesque level of income inequality in this country and want corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. Overwhelming support for that,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cEven in conservative states like Mississippi, there is an overwhelming understanding that we spend twice as much on health care as any other country. This crisis is becoming more and more obvious to the American people as we face the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. Imagine facing a pandemic and having 87 million who are having a difficult time going to a doctor when they need it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it is not just the ideological debate that our progressive movement is winning,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are winning the generational debate. While Joe Biden continues to do very well with older Americans, especially those above 65, our campaign continues to win the majority of the votes of younger people . . . Not just people in their 20s. People in their 30s and their 40s.\u201d\n\nSanders said that while he is winning the ideological debate, he is losing the \u201celectability debate\u201d as voters who say they agree with him on the issues argue that Biden has a better chance to beat President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion. But that is what millions of Democrats and independents believe,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden,\u201d he added, vowing to challenge Biden on issues such as climate change, college tuition, criminal justice, health care, immigration and income inequality.\n\n\u201cToday, I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and speak to the issues of concern to them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet me conclude the way I began: Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,\u201d he added. \u201cSunday night, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 comments came after Biden pitched a message of unity Tuesday to his supporters.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd together, we\u2019ll defeat Donald Trump. We\u2019ll defeat him together.\n\nBiden extended his delegate lead Tuesday following a dominant performance that saw him win 10 of 14 states last week. Sanders lost Michigan and Missouri by wide margins despite effectively tying Hillary Clinton in those states in 2016. Biden has been buoyed by overwhelming support from older and black voters, while Sanders\u2019 young supporters have not turned out at the rate necessary to mitigate Biden\u2019s advantage among more reliable voting blocs.\n\nSome of Biden\u2019s supporters called on Sanders to quit the race Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic strategist James Carville argued that Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t diss\u201d the majority of voters who backed Biden and \u201cwant to shut this thing down.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s shut this puppy down, and let\u2019s move on and worry about November,\u201d he said on MSNBC. \u201cThis thing is decided. There\u2019s no reason to keep it going not even a day longer.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., went a step further and argued that the Democratic National Committee should \u201cstep in\u201d to cancel future debates.\n\n\u201cI think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination . . . If the night ends the way it has begun,\u201d it is time to \u201cshut this primary down,\u201d Clyburn told NPR.\n\nSunday\u2019s debate will be held without a live audience due to precautions amid the spread of the coronavirus. Both candidates have also canceled rallies in upcoming primary states as the threat posed by the virus threatens to upend the race entirely, possibly making it more difficult for Sanders to gain ground.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Wash., the co-chair of Sanders\u2019 campaign, told CNN that Sanders \u201cearned his right to make his case at the debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the polling and momentum right now is with Vice President Biden, and Sen. Sanders acknowledges that. But he does believe that debates in the past have changed, dramatically, the race,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of things he is passionate about in his vision for America, and he feels he owes it to the millions of working-class people who have supported him to continue to raise those issues and share his vision.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Religious Right"], "authors": ["Igor Derysh"], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 11 23:11:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet.org", "title": "Bernie Sanders rejects calls to drop out \u2014 and vows to challenge Joe Biden on key issues at debate", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/bernie-sanders-rejects-calls-to-drop-out-and-vows-to-challenge-joe-biden-on-key-issues-at-debate/", "type": "article", "description": "Sen.
