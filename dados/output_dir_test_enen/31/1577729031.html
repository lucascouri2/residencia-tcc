A 99-year-old WWII <strong><a href="https://doyouremember.com/tag/veteran">veteran</a></strong> has beaten COVID-19! He was given a round of applause as he was discharged from the hospital. Albert Chambers is back home after recovering from the deadly virus at Tickhill Road Hospital in Doncaster, northern England. The courageous vet turns 100 in July!</p><p>Albert was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago after injuring his wrist in a fall. While he was there, he began to show coronavirus-like symptoms and soon tested positive for the <strong><a href="https://doyouremember.com/tag/virus">virus</a></strong>. Despite everyone fearing the worst, he miraculously recovered.
