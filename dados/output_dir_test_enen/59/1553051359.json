The publication also reports that the duo had a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.\n\nNgwenya who is now facing a murder charge in connection with Banda\u2019s death has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.\n\nThe State, however, opposed the bail application arguing that there was no guarantee that Ngwenya would not abscond once released on bail. Representing the State, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said:\n\nThe applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would, therefore, be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding.\n\nShe added that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and the investigations have been completed hence releasing him would not serve justice.\n\nThe amount of money which te duo was fighting for is not known.\n\nMore: The Chronicle\n\nQuick NetOne, Telecel, Africom, And Econet Airtime Recharge Number to recharge: Airtime amount: Eco Cash number: {{error_message}} {{error_message}} {{notice}} If anything goes wrong, click here to enter your query.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Binga", "Gokwe"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 18 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://t792ae.c2.acecdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cropped-pindula-icon-512x512-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#D5E0EB", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Zimbabwean Businessman Kills Zambian Business Partner Over Profits Sharing Dispute \u22c6 Pindula News", "description": "A Gokwe man, Evans Ngwenya (20) allegedly fatally struck his Zambian business partner, Paul Banda, with a log and fractured his skull following a dispute over the sharing of profits after the two had sold fish.
