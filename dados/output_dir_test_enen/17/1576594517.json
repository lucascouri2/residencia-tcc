Two sons\n\nBefore politics: Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague\n\nA married father of two, Mr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938.\n\nHe was was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his master's.\n\nHe worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve.\n\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as \"obnoxious bigots\" in an online article also claiming men were getting \"a raw deal\".\n\nMrs May accused him of fuelling \"gender warfare\".\n\nMr Raab remained on the back benches for five years after becoming an MP.\n\nBut the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015.\n\nHe played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister.\n\nCabinet role\n\nIn 2017, Mr Raab was branded \"offensive\" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying \"the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem\".\n\nBut in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior.\n\nIn Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government.\n\nAnd in July that year, when Mr Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post.\n\nYet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, criticising her position on Brexit.\n\nHe argued that he could not \"in good conscience\" support the \"backstop\" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Dominic Raab met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London in January\n\nAs an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected.\n\nAfter Mrs May announced she was standing down last year, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister.\n\nIn a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him.\n\nMark Francois, one of the most strongly pro-Brexit of Tory MPs, said: \"Whoever wins, and I hope it's Boris, I hope they find a good place for Dom in their cabinet, because I think he deserves it.\"\n\nMr Johnson, to whom Mr Raab gave his support after his elimination from the the race, did just that. On 24 July last year he became foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister.\n\nThe new job gave him an international profile surpassed only by Mr Johnson's, in terms of the UK government.\n\nBut he only narrowly managed to hold on to Esher and Walton at last December's general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenged by 2,743 votes.\n\nThe overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to \"get Brexit done\", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January this year.\n\nSince then coronavirus has taken over from Brexit as the UK government's number one priority, although tough negotiations on a trade deal with Brussels are continuing, via video link.\n\nNow Mr Raab, as well as being first secretary of state, has effectively taken over running the country as Mr Johnson is being treated in hospital for coronavirus.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A look at the man assuming some of the PM's duties while Boris Johnson is in hospital with coronavirus.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A look at the man assuming some of the PM's duties while Boris Johnson is in hospital with coronavirus.", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "US", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "US", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 155781721, "og": {"title": "Who is Dominic Raab?", "type": "article", "description": "A look at the man assuming some of the PM's duties while Boris Johnson is in hospital with coronavirus.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52064637", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1529C/production/_111448668_mediaitem111448667.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
