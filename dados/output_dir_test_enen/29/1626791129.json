At 12 months old, Archie is getting bigger every day and growing into a toddler with likes and dislikes, favorite songs and books and colors, and a whole little internal world. While it seems like just yesterday that Meghan was refusing to pose on church steps with newborn Archie (iconic), the truth is that baby Archie isn\u2019t such a baby anymore. In fact, this royal tot is even talking now \u2014 and his first words to Meghan and Harry prove Archie\u2019s got everything he needs at home.\n\nA source close to the couple told Us Weekly that Archie started talking while the Sussexes have been staying in LA. \u201cHe\u2019s saying a few words, like \u2018Dada,\u2019 \u2018Mama,\u2019 \u2018book,\u2019 and \u2018dog,'\u201d says the source \u2014 all of which make perfect sense. After all, it\u2019s well-known that Archie is \u201cbest friends\u201d with Meghan and Harry\u2019s two dogs, Guy the beagle and a black Labrador.\n\nIt seems Archie\u2019s an avid reader too (well, listener). For his birthday, mom Meghan read him one of his favorites, Duck! Rabbit!, and the source reveals he\u2019s picking up some new hobbies too: \u201cHe loves playing hide-and-seek and using building blocks.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s growing up so fast \u2014 and we\u2019re sure Meghan and Harry feel the same way. Given his incredible, history-making parents, Archie has a bright future. Those building blocks are just the beginning.\n\nClick here for an inside look at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s relationship.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Prince Harry", "baby archie", "meghan markle"], "authors": ["Louisa Ballhaus"], "publish_date": "Fri Jun  5 15:10:10 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "1-year-old Baby Archie recently started talking.
