He said the pandemic will likely last at least this year, and possibly longer.\n\nWith 200 infections, the Asian travel hub has signaled that there is a chance of a recession this year and has cut its growth forecasts.\n\nLee\u2019s comments came a day after Singapore revised its electoral boundaries, in a move usually seen as a precursor to calling a vote. Singapore must hold elections by early 2021. Before the virus hit the Asian city-state late in January, the government had been expected to call a vote within a few months.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["virus", "badly", "singapore"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Monitoring Desk"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore\u2019s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis,...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "Virus may badly hit Singapore | Business | thenews.com.pk", "description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore\u2019s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis,...", "keywords": "virus,badly,singapore", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "Virus may badly hit Singapore", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore\u2019s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis,...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/629203-virus-may-badly-hit-singapore", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@MDMonitoring Desk", "title": "Virus may badly hit Singapore", "description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore\u2019s prime minister warned on Saturday that the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will likely be deeper and more prolonged than the 2008 financial crisis,...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=070208"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/629203-virus-may-badly-hit-singapore"}
