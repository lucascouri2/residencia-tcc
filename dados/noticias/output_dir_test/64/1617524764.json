recovery fund of \u20ac750 billion, which it says is designed to repair the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the money would be disbursed via grants and loans, with the commission using the EU budget as leverage to raise funds on the financial markets.\n\nAfter the pandemic hit Europe, there were weeks of division and rancour over the EU's response, with the worst hit countries accusing richer northern member states of lacking a spirit of solidarity.\n\nThe EU has already approved \u20ac540 billion in soft loans and supports in its immediate response, but today's proposal is for the big recovery effort that Europe will need once the pandemic passes.\n\nThe plan is that the commission would raise new forms of revenue for its seven-year budget, and then use that money to raise the \u20ac750 billion on the markets.\n\nThat money would go to the member states, regions and economic sectors worst hit.\n\nThe digital economy and the new European Green Deal, designed to make the continent carbon neutral by 2050, would be prioritised.\n\nThe idea is that lessons will be learned and extra resources channeled to research and development, and to stockpiling vital medical and personal protective equipment.\n\nBut the plans will face formidable opposition from member states such as Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThey are the so-called \"frugal four\", who only want the recovery fund to come by way of loans, which will have to be paid back by member states.\n\nRead:\n\nThe nuts and bolts of EU's plan to restart the stuttering economy\n\nLatest coronavirus stories", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tony Connelly",
