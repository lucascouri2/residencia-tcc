Latin America is widely perceived to be one of the most affected regions given its undeniable connection and reliance on international companies doing businesses there. We provide a summary of the current legal landscape in some of the most relevant jurisdictions, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay as it concerns challenges that the pandemic is presenting to international companies operating in Latin America.\n\nQuestions we answer include:\n\nAre employer mandatory screenings and medical evaluations enforceable?\n\nHas any economic package (e.g., government sponsor loans, tax incentives) been adopted?\n\nIs there a concept similar to \u201cfurlough\u201d?\n\nIf it exists, what is the procedure and legal terms for its exercise?\n\nIf it does not exist, what options would the employer have before Acts of God (or extreme circumstances such as those we are experiencing), and what are the risks of implementing furlough-type strategies in the jurisdiction?\n\nThis summary will be updated regularly as the legal landscape evolves in Latin American countries.\n\nThe Latin America team at Morgan Lewis has deep cultural and business ties with the region and a unique understanding of the challenges presented to our clients doing business there, and the necessary tools to address them. We work closely with a trusted network of local Latin America law firms.
