LG, Panasonic, and Vizio, which previously expressed interest in bringing Filmmaker Mode to TVs, also shared details about their implementations of the setting.\n\nAccording to Variety, LG said it will have Filmmaker Mode in \u201cevery new 4K and 8K TV that we introduce in 2020.\u201d Panasonic said its 2020 OLED HD 2000 series will include the Filmmaker Mode, with more on the way. And LG, Panasonic, and Vizio all confirmed that their TVs with Filmmaker Mode will be able to automatically turn it on, according to FlatpanelsHD (a feature I will explain a bit later).\n\nSamsung, TP Vision, and Kaleidescape have not shared which TVs will have Filmmaker Mode. And notably absent from the list of TV providers that have pledged to include Filmmaker Mode are Sony and TCL.\n\nThe goal of Filmmaker Mode is to make movies on TVs look a lot better. Right now, many HD TVs have motion smoothing turned on by default, which applies a lot of post-processing to what you\u2019re watching and can sometimes create a blurry, overly smooth picture, referred to as the \u201csoap opera effect.\u201d That can make movies look much different \u2014 and usually much worse \u2014 than the filmmaker intended them to.\n\nFilmmaker Mode could fix the \u201csoap opera effect\u201d\n\nMotion smoothing isn\u2019t the easiest thing to turn off, as you usually have to know what the setting is called on your specific TV (LG calls it the not-obvious \u201cTruMotion,\u201d for example) and know exactly where to turn it off in your TV\u2019s settings. (Fortunately, we have a guide to help with that.)\n\nFilmmaker Mode is supposed to remove all of that post-processing so that movies on your home TV look the way their filmmakers made them to look (hopefully without the soap opera effect). The UHD Alliance also wants to make Filmmaker Mode easy to use by having it to turn on by default. That means you won\u2019t have to dive into your TV\u2019s settings just to see The Irishman the way Martin Scorsese wanted it. And if you do want to turn Filmmaker Mode on manually, the UHD Alliance is also standardizing the Filmmaker Mode name across all TVs that have the mode so you can more easily find it in your TV\u2019s settings.\n\nNot surprisingly, Filmmaker Mode also has the backing of a number of directors, including Scorsese, J.J. Abrams, James Cameron, Ryan Coogler, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, and Christopher Nolan.
