But Assange last month failed in a bail bid based on his risk of catching the virus, with a British judge saying there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for his release.\n\nAssange faces charges under the US Espionage Act for the 2010 release of a trove of secret files detailing aspects of US military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe ensconced himself in the Ecuadoran embassy in 2012 after skipping bail to avoid separate legal proceedings in Sweden, but was finally dragged out last year.\n\nHe reportedly conceived the first child with Morris in 2016, according to the Mail yesterday.\n\nAssange watched the birth of both children in London hospitals via live video-link and met the elder boy, named Gabriel, after he was smuggled into the embassy, the paper added. Both boys are said to be British citizens and have reportedly visited their father in prison.\n\nMorris told the Mail yesterday: \u201cI love Julian deeply and I am looking forward to marrying him. Julian has been fiercely protective of me and has done his best to shield me from the nightmares of his life.\u201d\n\nShe said she had lived \u201cquietly and privately\u201d, raising Gabriel and his brother Max, while \u201clonging for the day we could be together as a family\u201d.\n\nMorris added: \u201cNow, I have to speak out because I can see that his life is on the brink.\u201d \u2014 AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Apr 13 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two children with one of his lawyers while holed up in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London for much of the past decade, a report yesterday said", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two children with one of his lawyers while holed up in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London for much of the past decade, a report yesterday said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Assange fathered 2 kids with lawyer in Ecuador embassy", "description": "LONDON \u2022 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fathered two children with one of his lawyers while holed up in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London for much of the past decade, a report yesterday said.
