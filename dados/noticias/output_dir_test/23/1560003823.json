This proposed approach makes no sense, and will needlessly lead to preventable deaths, according to public health officials.\n\nHere's a copy:\n\nFrom the WSJ:\n\nIn a letter to governors on Thursday, President Trump said the administration's growing testing capabilities would enable it to publish, in consultation with public-health officials and scientists, criteria for classifying counties by risk.\n\nPresident Trump in letter to governors on coronavirus says, \"There is still a long battle ahead, but our efforts are already paying dividends.\" He says the administration is working on \"new guidelines\" to possibly increase or relax social distancing and mitigation measures. pic.twitter.com/QcWQg0e7G8 \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) March 26, 2020\n\nAs testing has ramped up, it has become clear that in states like New York and Louisiana the coronavirus could have been spreading undetected for weeks.
