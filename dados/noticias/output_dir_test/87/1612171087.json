Andrew Cuomo said Monday.\n\nCuomo described preliminary data from about 8,000 tests performed by the health care provider Northwell Health during a slideshow presentation; he didn\u2019t go through underlying data or details about testing procedure. The screenings were the result of a partnership between Northwell, New York\u2019s department of health, and several churches throughout the city that are serving as testing centers.\n\nThe tests showed the disparate impact of the viral disease: 27% of those tested across the churches in low-income neighborhoods carried COVID-19 antibodies, Cuomo said, compared to the 19.9% overall rate in the city.\n\nA whopping 34% of those tested in the Bronx were positive for antibodies, compared to 29% in Brooklyn and 25% in Queens, Cuomo said. Staten Island and Manhattan hovered around the city-wide average.\n\n\u201cThe data shows not just a high positive \u2014 not just that a high number of people had the positive \u2014 but the spread is continuing in those communities and that\u2019s where the new cases are coming from,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou can literally do that on a zip code basis.\u201d\n\nIn Morrisania, in the Bronx, 43% of those tested were positive for antibodies, Cuomo said, more than double the city-wide rate. Forty-one percent of respondents at a site in Brownsville, Brooklyn, tested positive for antibodies. The sites had rates of hospitalization near or over double the rates city-wide, according to the preliminary data.\n\nA spokesperson for Northwell told TPM in an email that it had \u201cperformed more than 9,250 tests in the first week at 11 churches.\u201d The tests consisted of nasal swabs for the virus and antibody tests on alternating days, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe city\u2019s viral disparities were also apparent in a map of case and death rates released by the city earlier this week, which showed the disparate impact of COVID-19 in lower-income areas far from the city\u2019s wealthy center.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Northwell health", "antibody testing", "Andrew Cuomo"], "authors": ["Matt Shuham", "Cristina Cabrera", "Jake Pearson", "Kaila Philo", "Josh Kovensky", "May", "Mattshuham", "October"], "publish_date": "Wed May 20 18:04:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thousands of coronavirus tests performed in low-income communities of color around New York City showed rates of infection much higher than the city average\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Thousands of coronavirus tests performed in low-income communities of color around New York City showed rates of infection much higher than the city average\u2026", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1214132986-804x564.jpg", "secure_url": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1214132986-804x564.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "In Poor Bronx Neighborhoods, 34% Tested Had COVID-19 Antibodies, Gov Says", "description": "Thousands of coronavirus tests performed in low-income communities of color around New...", "url": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/in-poor-bronx-neighborhoods-34-tested-had-covid-19-antibodies-gov-says", "site_name": "TPM", "updated_time": "2020-05-20T18:06+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-20T18:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-20T18:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TPM", "title": "In Poor Bronx Neighborhoods, 34% Tested Had COVID-19 Antibodies, Gov Says", "description": "Thousands of coronavirus tests performed in low-income communities of color around New...", "image": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1214132986-804x564.jpg", "site": "@TPM"}, "fb": {"admins": 12330256, "pages": 98658495398}}, "canonical_link": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/in-poor-bronx-neighborhoods-34-tested-had-covid-19-antibodies-gov-says"}
