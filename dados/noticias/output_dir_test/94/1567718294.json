Currently, the U.S. has two vaccines authorized and recommended for use: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two shots, 21 days apart. The Moderna vaccine requires two shots 28 days apart.\n\nWho is the most at risk to get the coronavirus?\n\nAccording to the CDC adults of any age with certain conditions, such as cancer, COPD, heart conditions, Down Syndrome, obesity, smoking, sickle cell disease, type 2 diabetes and pregnancy are at increased risk of getting severely sick. Older adults are also at greater risk of hospitalization or death if they get the coronavirus.\n\nThose in areas and communities with systemic health and social inequities, including racial and ethnic minority groups, rural communities, people experiencing homelessness, people with disabilities are at increased risk of getting sick from coronavirus as well.\n\nHow can I prevent getting coronavirus?\n\nThe biggest prevention method for most illnesses is washing your hands. The CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or about as long as the \u201cAlphabet\u201d song. If soap and water are not available, you should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\nWearing a mask prevents the spread of coronavirus. Masks should be snug on the face and cover the nose and mouth. They should not be worn around the neck or hanging off of ears.\n\n\u00bbClick here to get the new AJC Mobile App\n\nHow can I prevent spreading coronavirus to others?\n\nIf you are sick -- whether with coronavirus or not, you should stay home. When you sneeze or cough, cover your mouth with a tissue and throw it in the trash. If you don\u2019t have a tissue, the CDC says to cough or sneeze into your elbow. Frequently touched objects and surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected frequently, according to the CDC. Masks should also be worn.\n\nProper handwashing should be practiced at all times.\n\nHow long does coronavirus live on a surface?\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cCoronaviruses on surfaces and objects naturally die within hours to days.\u201d Exposure to sunlight and warmer temperatures will decrease the time the virus survives on objects and surfaces.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has a list of disinfectants for use against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nCan you transmit or get coronavirus from your pet?\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, the risk of pets spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 in people is low. There\u2019s currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus.\n\nThere have been multiple cases of domestic pets testing positive for COVID-19, including a family dog in New York that died of the illness.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kelcie Willis", "About The Author", "Kelcie Willis Is A Writer", "Online Content Producer For The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
