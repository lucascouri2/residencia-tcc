by now, this whole coronavirus thing has gotten entirely out of hand and up until just yesterday, our government (under the direction of Donald Trump) had essentially done a whole lot of nothing about it.\n\nThe virus has been raging around the world and across the United States for literally months now, but Trump and his team are only now starting to gear up and at least open up some legitimate pathways to combat the mess.\n\nAs a result, there are a hell of a lot of press conferences going on these days.\n\nTypically speaking, these things are just an \u201cupdate\u201d on what\u2019s new in the world of COVID-19, based on whatever information they managed to gather in that day\u2019s closed-door meeting and a healthy doubling-down on the CDC and WHO\u2019s recommendations to help prevent and further transmission of the virus \u2014 including hand washing, social distancing, and NOT TOUCHING YOUR FACE.\n\nHowever, it seems that absolutely no one in Donald Trump\u2019s administration is yet willing to follow these guidelines. And I mean even the doctor.\n\nAs part of today\u2019s presser, United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson delivered some remarks to the nation from the podium. And THIS GUY literally opened up his remarks by coughing into his hand and then TOUCHING. HIS. FACE.\n\nSeriously. He coughed into his fist and then just a few moments later moved the offending hand to his face and touched it, right beside his nose.\n\nYou literally can\u2019t make this stuff up, y\u2019all.\n\nIt\u2019s really no wonder people are panic buying toilet paper and potatoes when this is the administration we\u2019re currently forced to depend on to pull us out of the trenches.\n\nFeatured image via screen capture\n\nLike what you see here?
