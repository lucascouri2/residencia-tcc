Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger said that many things are under consideration right now, and that includes taking the temperature of all guests. As the unprecedented temporary closures of the global parks continue, many are wondering which new guidelines may be put into place.\n\nAs COVID-19 is battled and researched around the world, people are learning new ways to monitor the symptoms and keep things in check. It's proven difficult for medical professionals to know everything about this new illness, and that is why Disney will be overly cautious.\n\nWalt Disney World and Disneyland both shut its doors in mid-March, and they will remain shuttered until further notice. In a recent interview with Barron's, Iger spoke of new methods that the company is discussing for when the parks reopen.\n\nNothing is set in stone as of this time, but Iger confirmed that the safety of the guests and cast members is the top priority. Some of the discussions include the idea of checking the temperatures of everyone who enters Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and every park.\n\n\"Just as we now do bag checks for everybody that goes into our parks, it could be that at some point we add a component of that that takes people's temperatures, as a for-instance.\"\n\nAll Disney parks around the world have bag checks at their points of entry, and that has significantly advanced over the years. In the last decade alone, Disney has added metal detectors, additional personnel, and is currently improving the security entry areas to make it better for all guests.\n\nIger is not ignoring the possible problems that could come along with taking the temperature of every guest to enter the Walt Disney World or Disneyland parks. He realizes that it could cause extra delays, but guests need to understand this is for the best interest of everyone.\n\n\"So we've asked ourselves the question, let's prepare for a world where our customers demand that we scrutinize everybody. Even if it creates a little bit of hardship, like it takes a little bit longer for people to get in.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Apr  7 19:06:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Walt Disney World May Check Every Guest's Temperature Before Entry, Says Bob Iger", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Walt Disney World May Check Every Guest's Temperature Before Entry, Says Bob Iger", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5986309/bob-iger-disney-parks-temperature/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Walt Disney World May Check Every Guest's Temperature Before Entry, Says Bob Iger", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walt-disney-world-parks.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2020-04-07 19:06:00Z", "section": "News"}, "description": "Walt Disney World May Check Every Guest's Temperature Before Entry, Says Bob Iger", "keywords": "News", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5986309/bob-iger-disney-parks-temperature/"}
