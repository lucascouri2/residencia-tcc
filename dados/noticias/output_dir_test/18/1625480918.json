But border closings throughout Central America due to the coronavirus pandemic have left them stranded at shelters in Pe\u00f1itas, just over the border, for almost two months.\n\nAbout 2,000 migrants at the camp have complained about water and sanitation conditions and fear catching the coronavirus, but Panamanian authorities said Wednesday they will not be allowed to continue their journey.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPolice went to the camp to turn back those trying to leave.\n\n\u201cAfter a dialogue with the migrants, they were informed that there can be no movement toward the border with Costa Rica, because of the existence of COVID-19, and they have peacefully returned to the Pe\u00f1itas station,\u201d the National Border Service wrote in its Twitter account.\n\nThe migrants say many of them have run out of money to buy food and water at the isolated camp. About 15 migrants have been reported to have been infected with the coronavirus, but the number appears not to have grown in weeks.\n\nPanama has reported 357 coronavirus deaths, the highest number in Central America.\n\nShare this: Share\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nSkype\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nPocket\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nRelated", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["panama", "migrants stuck in panama"], "authors": ["Is An Aggregator Of News For Latin America.
