It might be your colleague\u2019s cell phone\u2026or it might be a robocaller or scammer. So here\u2019s a way you can spot some of those scam calls you might be getting. And it\u2019s a way to spread the word to help protect others in your community.\n\nUse the #FTCScamBingo card to check off the scammers you spotted, along with the steps you took to stop them. Scams related to the Coronavirus are growing. Some scammers are promising that you can refinance your mortgage or get student loan debt forgiveness \u2013 for a fee, of course. You might spot phishing scams, where scammers try to get your Social Security number (SSN) or financial info \u2013 maybe to guarantee you access to a COVID-19 vaccine (remember: there\u2019s still no vaccine, so definitely no access). They might say they\u2019re from Medicare (they\u2019re not) with a health kit, from the CDC (again, not) with a vaccine kit, or the Social Security Administration (nope), telling you there\u2019s a problem with your SSN (there\u2019s not). And some scammers might even still be running some of their go-to favorites: tech support, utilities, or lower-your-interest-rate scams.\n\nWant to avoid and help warn others about scams like these? Print out or save this bingo card. Share it on social media (#FTCScamBingo) and ask your friends to play along. Then, as you take a step to avoid a scam, or you spot one of these scams (or write in your own), mark it off. When you have bingo, share it with the FTC on Facebook (@FederalTradeCommission) or Twitter (@FTC). You\u2019ll be helping the FTC \u2013 and others \u2013 know what\u2019s going on.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t play bingo, please report scams to the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint.
