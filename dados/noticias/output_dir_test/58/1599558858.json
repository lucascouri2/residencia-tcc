That compared with a company-compiled consensus of a 14.7% drop.\n\nIn the US, AB InBev's largest market, the company lost market share as the craze for hard seltzer - sparkling, often fruit-flavoured alcoholic beverages - accelerated, although the company is pushing more into this category.\n\nSales in stores also rose, disproportionately benefiting established brands such as its own and larger packs, though it was not clear if this would continue long term.\n\nStores across the world have seen surging sales of beer, wine and spirits, although the pace in many countries has slowed and it seems unlikely to make up the shortfall from lost sales in bars, clubs and restaurants.\n\nIn Brazil, the company's second largest market, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of the year as many states forced the closure in March of bars and restaurants, which account for more than half of AB InBev's drinks volumes in the country.\n\nIt is hoping to expand a service delivering cold beer to customers within an hour from closed venues.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu May  7 08:45:52 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "",
