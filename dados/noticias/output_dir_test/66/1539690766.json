They have abandoned American principles to instead focus on their unpopular woke agenda,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cTulsi understands that and has been a voice of reason and common sense across party lines. She is courageously speaking her mind and showing us all what it means to be a leading independent thinker.\u201d\n\nDixon is trying to unseat Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Nov. 8. A request for comment was made by the Advance to the Dixon campaign, but was not returned.\n\nMartini last week expressed on Twitter her anger at Dixon accepting Gabbard\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201c10 years ago, Bashar al-Assad blew up my parents\u2019 house while they were still inside,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYesterday, Assad\u2019s former best friend in Congress, Tulsi Gabbard, endorsed Tudor Dixon and will campaign with her next week. I am so disgusted I can\u2019t even express it in words.\u201d\n\nMartini, who was born in Aleppo, Syria, told the Michigan Advance that the fact Dixon would welcome someone like Gabbard doesn\u2019t speak well for her character.\n\n\u201cYou either have to be very ignorant to not know what or who Tulsi Gabbard is, or you don\u2019t care,\u201d said Martini. \u201cAnd either is horrible, because if she\u2019s ignorant, she\u2019s not fit to be a governor. And if she knows, that\u2019s even worse. She knows who this woman is and who she supports, and she is happy that she endorsed her?\u201d\n\nMartini said both of her parents, who were surgeons, built a hospital in Aleppo in the 1980s, with their home on the top floor, where she grew up.\n\nMartini fled Syria in 1992 after studying abroad, saying she did not want to return to life under the \u201cbrutal dictatorship\u201d of Hafez al-Assad, the father of Bashar al-Assad. She has a B.S. in architectural engineering from the University of Aleppo and an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan, according to her website.\n\nWhen mass protests erupted in Syria in 2011, Bashar al-Assad ordered his military to brutally put them down, starting a civil war that in the decade since has killed more than half-million people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nIn 2012, Martini said she learned that her parents\u2019 hospital had been attacked.\n\n\u201cOne of my cousins, who is the pharmacist at the hospital, put a Facebook post saying that the Martini Hospital was hit,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course, I went crazy because my parents lived there. So I started calling. I called my mother; I called my father; I called the hospital. No one was answering the hospital phone. I was crying. I mean, it was just so stressful. So I called my cousin and he said, \u2018They\u2019re all in the basement with the patients and everybody, they\u2019re hiding in the basement.\u2019 Even recounting the story, I\u2019m so shaken. It was just a horrible, horrible night.\u201d\n\nMartini says she later learned that the attack occurred when a tank shot at soldiers manning a checkpoint in front of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t care less if there was a hospital behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the Syrian regime for you. That\u2019s standard practice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that type of brutality that Martini says Gabbard aided and abetted and shouldn\u2019t be forgiven.\n\nGabbard endorsed U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, which led some to label her a progressive.\n\nHowever, in 2017, Gabbard, then a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, stunned party leaders when she announced that she had met with Bashar al-Assad during a trip to Syria, which she described as a \u201cfact-finding\u201d mission.\n\nShe drew criticism from both sides of the aisle when she described the opposition to al-Assad as \u201cterrorists,\u201d and later was skeptical al-Assad\u2019s regime was responsible for a chemical weapons attack in April 2017 that killed more than a hundred people.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town on October 15, 2019 in Ceylanpinar, Turkey. The military action is part of a campaign to extend Turkish control of more of northern Syria, a large swath of which is currently held by Syrian Kurds, whom Turkey regards as a threat. U.S. President Donald Trump granted tacit American approval to this campaign, withdrawing his country\u2019s troops from several Syrian outposts near the Turkish border. | Burak Kara/Getty Images\n\nShe has also been labeled by those on the left and right as a Vladimir Putin apologist, helping push Kremlin-backed talking points.\n\nIn 2020, Gabbard unsuccessfully ran for president as Democrat, even though Sanders ran again. Both lost to now-President Joe Biden. Earlier this month, Gabbard announced she was leaving the Democratic Party. She began campaigning for many Republicans across the country who won former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, like Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who is facing Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats of today are hostile to people of faith and spirituality,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cThey demonize the police and protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans. The Democrats of today believe in open borders and weaponize the national security state to go after political opponents.\u201d\n\nBut for Martini, the memory of that day 10 years ago when she thought she had lost her parents goes beyond politics.\n\n\u201cJust remembering this story makes me so anxious and upset,\u201d said Martini. \u201cAnd then this woman comes in and she wants to come to Michigan and she wants to support Tudor Dixon? I don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s just beyond words.\u201d\n\nMichigan Advance is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
