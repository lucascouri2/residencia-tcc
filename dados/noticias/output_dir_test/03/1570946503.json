PiS had managed to benefit from a rebellion in the ranks of its small coalition partner Porozumienie on Monday morning \u2013 which only partly opposed holding the elections \u2013 and a vote in favour passed at second time of asking.\n\nAfter the majority of Porozumienie had not backed their party leader, Jaros\u0142aw Gowin had resigned from the post of deputy prime minister and higher education minister on Monday (6 April).\n\nNow, the Senate will have up to 30 days to approve the bill.\n\nBut given that the opposition is in charge of the chamber it is likely that it will use these days fully, leaving just a few days to prepare the elections, an impossible task in terms of logistics.\n\nThat\u2019s why PiS wants to empower the Speaker of the Sejm to move the date of the elections for example to 17 May, despite this being a flagrant breach of the law and the constitution, according to many law professors.\n\nGrzegorz Schetyna, the former leader of the largest opposition party, tweeted that the current situation is a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d and even some influential (centre) right-wing media and journalists had begun to appeal to Kaczy\u0144ski to \u201cstop demolishing the state\u201d and to \u201cstop the madness\u201d of going ahead with the elections during the time of the pandemic.\n\n(\u0141ukasz Gadza\u0142a | EURACTIV.pl)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["\u0141ukasz Gadza\u0142a"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr  7 08:27:13 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "WARSAW - The end of dreams?"}, "og": {"title": "WARSAW - The end of dreams?", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/warsaw-the-end-of-dreams/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/warsaw-the-end-of-dreams/"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-07 08:27:13", "author": "\u0141ukasz Gadza\u0142a"}, "fb": {"pages": 15299247059}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/warsaw-the-end-of-dreams/"}
