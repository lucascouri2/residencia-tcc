The expanded policy will now include those leaving dissident groups of former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC, in Spanish), and the Clan del Golfo, Los Pelusos and Los Caparros crime gangs.\n\nSome 4,400 ELN guerrillas have taken advantage of this initiative, according to the office of the High Commissioner for Peace.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Steven Mcloud Di\u00e1logo"], "publish_date": "Fri May  8 13:30:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dialogo-americas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cropped-favicon-1-1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "20 ELN Members Surrender to Colombian Forces After Clashes in the Cauca Region - Di\u00e1logo Am\u00e9ricas", "description": "Twenty National Liberation Army (ELN, in Spanish) members, recognized as the last guerrilla in Colombia, surrendered to the military following clashes in the Cauca department in the southwestern part of the country, Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque announced on April 29, via Twitter.\u00a0 Colombian Minister of Defense Carlos Holmes-Trujillo echoed Duque\u2019s announcement, congratulating members of the [\u2026]", "url": "https://dialogo-americas.com/articles/20-eln-members-surrender-to-colombian-forces-after-clashes-in-the-cauca-region/", "site_name": "Di\u00e1logo Am\u00e9ricas", "image": {"identifier": "https://dialogo-americas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COL-20-ELN-Members-Surrender-to-Colombian-Force.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 666, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-08T13:30:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-04-07T03:19:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Geraldine Cook", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WPML ver:4.3.6 stt:1,42,2;", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dialogo-americas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cropped-favicon-1-1-270x270.png", "position": 3, "url": "https://dialogo-americas.com/articles/20-eln-members-surrender-to-colombian-forces-after-clashes-in-the-cauca-region/"}, "canonical_link": "https://dialogo-americas.com/articles/20-eln-members-surrender-to-colombian-forces-after-clashes-in-the-cauca-region/"}
