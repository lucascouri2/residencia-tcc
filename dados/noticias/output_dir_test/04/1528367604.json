Radek Pietruszka/PAP\n\nPolish PM Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Brussels on Thursday to take part in an extraordinary EU summit devoted to the bloc's 2021-2027 budget.\n\nAccording to unofficial information, the summit, which was originally planned as a one-day meeting, may be prolonged at least until Friday.\n\nBefore the summit starts at 3 pm on Thursday, PMs of the regional Visegrad Group (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) will meet to co-ordinate their positions.\n\nAn EU budget proposal for 2021-2027 prepared by European Council President Charles Michel has been positively received by Polish diplomats. While Michel has maintained general cuts in cohesion policy he has also proposed a modification thanks to which around EUR 6 billion will be transferred from richer countries to poorer ones.\n\nMorawiecki met with Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in early February.\n\nPoland stresses that the size of the budget should be commensurate to the EU's political ambitions in the context of numerous challenges the bloc faces, including migration and climate, the statement went on to say.\n\nPoland and other less-developed EU members argue for a bigger EU budget, with particular stress on the cohesion and agricultural policies, while some net payers to the common budget want to curb the size of it, especially given the United Kingdom's departure from the bloc.\n\nThe most vocal net payers include Denmark, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands, who want the budget to be equivalent to about one percent of the combined Gross National Income of all 27 EU member states. They are opposed by the 17-strong group of the so-called Friends of Cohesion Policy, comprising Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Mateusz Morawiecki", "EU Summit", "EU budget", "Visegrad Group", "Friends of Cohesion Group", "Charles Michel", "Ursula von der Leyen"], "tags": ["Mateusz Morawiecki,", "Visegrad Group,", "Friends of Cohesion Group,", "EU Summit,", "Ursula von der Leyen,", "EU budget,", "Charles Michel"], "authors": ["Pap", "Jd Mf"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Brussels on Thursday to take part in an extraordinary EU summit devoted to the bloc's 2021-2027 budget.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.thefirstnews.com/img/logo-header.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Brussels on Thursday to take part in an extraordinary EU summit devoted to the bloc's 2021-2027 budget.", "keywords": "Mateusz Morawiecki, EU Summit, EU budget, Visegrad Group, Friends of Cohesion Group, Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen", "robots": "index,follow", "application-name": "", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thefirstnews-cms.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/img/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://thefirstnews-cms.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/img/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://thefirstnews-cms.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/img/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://thefirstnews-cms.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/img/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://thefirstnews-cms.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/img/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"title": "Polish PM arrives in Brussels to attend EU's key budget summit", "description": "Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Brussels on Thursday to take part in an extraordinary EU summit devoted to the bloc's 2021-2027 budget.", "url": "https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/polish-pm-arrives-in-brussels-to-attend-eus-key-budget-summit-10591", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.thefirstnews.com/1000x667/kb3qx7msvzrk2sxj5t58j.jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1000, "height": 667, "url": "https://images.thefirstnews.com/1000x667/kb3qx7msvzrk2sxj5t58j.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://images.thefirstnews.com/1000x667/kb3qx7msvzrk2sxj5t58j.jpeg"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/polish-pm-arrives-in-brussels-to-attend-eus-key-budget-summit-10591"}
