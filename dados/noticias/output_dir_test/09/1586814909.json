The champion took on the course with his characteristic zeal, finishing with a victory in his class and in fifth place overall.\n\nALSO READ: Motorists can now report minor accidents and obtain a case number online\n\nThe friendship between Carlo Abarth and the great champion began soon after WWII, when Nuvolari \u2013 who already had 55 victories in international Grand Prix and major road races under his belt \u2013 drove for Piero Dusio\u2019s Cisitalia, with Carlo Abarth leading the racing team.\n\nWhen Dusio sold his racing cars to Abarth before he emigrated to Argentina, Abarth knew he could count on the support of Nuvolari, who also took on the role of spokesman for his paddle shift tuning kits and mufflers.\n\nAbarth sports tuning kits converted city cars into race-winners, enabling many young drivers to compete successfully. \u201cSunday on the track, Monday in the office\u201d, went Carlo Abarth\u2019s slogan. He combined the production of racing components with working on the official team, whose victories were mainly on the track and in hill climbs, in coupe and sports cars.\n\nFollowing Nuvolari\u2019s celebrated victory, Abarth won the International Manufacturers Championship six times running between 1962 and 1967, also racking up wins in the 1972 European Championship for Makes with Arturo Merzario at the wheel, plus four triumphs in the European Touring Championships (in 1965, \u201966, \u201967, and \u201969).\n\nThe history of great successes for the Scorpion brand continued from the 1970s onward in rallies, with the Fiat 131 Abarth Rally winning three World Constructors\u2019 Championships in 1977, 1978 and 1980, a World Drivers\u2019 Championship in 1980 with the German driver Walter R\u00f6hrl behind the wheel, and an FIA Cup for Drivers in 1978 with Finland\u2019s Markku Al\u00e9n.\n\nSuch major victories were complemented by wins in seven European Rally Championships between 1975 and 2011, and by the Abarth 124 rally\u2019s 2018 and 2019 triumphs in the FIA R-GT Cup.\n\nA success story with a dual significance: on one hand, continuing to feature in race events, with the Abarth 124 rally running in the 2020 ERC, along with the team acting as technical partner on the track of the Italian and German F4 Championships.\n\nALSO READ: Rapid distribution to those in need is continued\n\nOn the other hand, for Abarth, racing has always been the ultimate testing ground for engines and technical/technological components. Testing under the most extreme conditions can lead to extraordinary levels of performance and reliability, boosting the competitive spirit while preparing for future technology transfer to models in mass production.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["local news", "breaking news", "news headlines", "Nelspruit", "Nelspruit News headlines", "Local news", "News", "Abarth", "lockdown", "Scorpion"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 23 12:00:28 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://lowvelder.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2020/08/site-icon-70x70.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "af_ZA"}, "type": "article", "title": "History of the Scorpion brand | Lowvelder", "description": "Nearly 70 years ago to the day, on April 10, 1950, the great champion Tazio Nuvolari ended his racing career behind the wheel of the Abarth 204A, the first model constructed by Carlo Abarth.\u00a0The time trial ran from the Sicilian capital of Palermo up Monte Pellegrino: a steep, evocative climb, featuring multiple hairpin bends on tarmac.", "url": "https://lowvelder.co.za/619291/history-of-the-scorpion-brand/", "site_name": "Lowvelder", "image": {"identifier": "https://lowvelder.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2020/04/tazio-nuvolari-al-volante-dell-abarth-204a_1800x1800-558281.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 728, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Laevelder-Lowvelder/158345657516798", "published_time": "2020-04-23T12:00:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-22T10:59:14+00:00"}, "author": "wesselcohrs", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@Lowvelder", "site": "@Lowvelder", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "wesselcohrs", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "fb": {"pages": 158345657516798, "app_id": 1512989512283895}, "keywords": "local news, breaking news, news headlines, Nelspruit, Nelspruit News headlines, Local news, News, Abarth, lockdown, Scorpion", "theme-color": "#d21e1f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://lowvelder.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2020/08/site-icon-270x203.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://lowvelder.co.za/619291/history-of-the-scorpion-brand/"}
