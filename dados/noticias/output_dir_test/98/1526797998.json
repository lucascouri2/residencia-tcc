Given the film\u2019s history of setbacks, the Spider-Man actor is thrilled to finally get a chance to play Nathan Drake on the big screen and recalled first being offered the role.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting,\u201d Holland told IGN, \u201cwhen I sat down with [Sony Pictures Chairman] Tom Rothman and we were talking about video games, and I was like \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve just finished Uncharted.\u2019 And he was like \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you play Nathan Drake?\u2019 I remember being like, \u2018I would do anything to play Nathan Drake. Please, that would be amazing.\u2019 So yeah, we start shooting in like four weeks. Mark Wahlberg is going to be amazing as Sully. The stunt department that we have out there in Berlin have done an amazing job already, prepping the stunts, and it\u2019s going to be an exciting one.\u201d\n\nJust to put things in perspective, Sony has been trying to make an Uncharted movie for so long that Wahlberg went from being attached as the lead to, well, playing the old guy. Not to mention, Bumblebee director Travis Knight exited the film at the end of December 2019, so it\u2019s pretty amazing that replacement Ruben Fleischer is getting Holland and company in front of the camera so quickly.\n\nAs for the film\u2019s troubled production, before Knight became the sixth director to run for the hills, David O. Russell, Neil Burger, Seth Gordon, Shawn Levy, and Dan Trachtenberg were all attached to helm Uncharted at some point in the past 12 years. On top of that, the role of Nathan Drake bounced from Walhberg to Chris Pratt and a slew of rumored contenders before locking down Holland in 2017 as he rocketed to fame as Marvel\u2019s new Spider-Man.\n\n(Via IGN)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["entertainment", "gaming", "movies", "mark wahlberg", "ruben fleischer", "sony pictures", "tom holland", "uncharted"], "tags": ["SONY PICTURES", "Tom Holland", "MARK WAHLBERG", "uncharted", "RUBEN FLEISCHER"], "authors": ["Mike Redmond", "Lexi Lane", "Danielle Chelosky", "Aaron Williams", "Derrick Rossignol"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 20 20:36:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After being in development hell for over a decade, Tom Holland confirms that the Uncharted movie is somehow actually filming.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/themes/uproxx/assets/images/tabicon.png", "meta_data": {"description": "After being in development hell for over a decade, Tom Holland confirms that the Uncharted movie is somehow actually filming.", "keywords": "entertainment, gaming, movies, mark wahlberg, ruben fleischer, sony pictures, tom holland, uncharted", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPROXX", "creator": "@UPROXX", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "Tom Holland Confirms That The Long-Developing \u2018Uncharted\u2019 Movie Is Actually Filming\u2026 Soon", "text": {"title": "Tom Holland Confirms That The Long-Developing \u2018Uncharted\u2019 Movie Is Actually Filming\u2026 Soon"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-holland-uncharted-feature.jpg?w=640", "alt": "tom holland"}}, "qc": {"post": "movies", "author": "Mike Redmond", "section": "movies", "primary_tag": "tom-holland"}, "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tom Holland Confirms \u2019Uncharted\u2019 Movie Is Actually Filming In Four Weeks", "url": "https://uproxx.com/movies/movies/", "description": "After being in development hell for over a decade, Tom Holland confirms that the Uncharted movie is somehow actually filming.", "site_name": "UPROXX", "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-holland-uncharted-feature.jpg?w=710", "width": 710, "height": 400, "alt": "tom holland"}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_GB"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-20T20:36:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-20T20:36:18+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "app_id": 117400151618132, "pages": 116548701336}}, "canonical_link": "https://uproxx.com/movies/movies/"}
