Listen Credit: Haaretz Weekly Ep. 60\n\nIn the article, the researchers also speculated that Israel was the place where the two species of dates known today \u2013 the Middle East (eastern) and North African (western) \u2013 first interbred.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time researchers have managed to germinate an ancient date seed. The first such tree, nicknamed Methuselah, was germinated from a seed discovered at Masada in 2005 by Dr. Elaine Solowey of the Arava Institute of Environmental Studies.\n\nOpen gallery view The tree researchers named 'Methuselah.'

But because it is male, it will never bear fruit.\n\nConsequently, Solowey and Dr. Sara Sallon of Hadassah Medical Organization decided to try to germinate additional seeds to give Methuselah a mate. The seeds they used were discovered in the 1960s during Yigal Yadin\u2019s digs at Masada and the archaeological excavations at Qumran on the northern Dead Sea.\n\nSolowey chose 32 whole seeds that seemed relatively healthy. She warmed them and gradually added moisture, so as not to make them rot. When six of them showed signs of life, she began giving them fertilizer and hormones.\n\nOpen gallery view Elaine Solowey of the Arava Institute of Environmental Studies with the tree named 'Judith.'

Three of them \u2013 Adam, Jonah and Hannah \u2013 were removed from their pots and planted in the ground at the Arava Institute this year.\n\nOpen gallery view 'Judith,' 'Boaz,' and 'Uriel.'

The fact that they were found at sites 300 meters below sea level may have protected them from radiation.\n\nAfter the seeds germinated, fragments of the seed shells were sent to Switzerland to be dated. The tests showed that they date to somewhere between the third century B.C.E. and the first century C.E. This overlaps with the peak period of human activity at Masada and Qumran, which was between the first century B.C.E. and the first century C.E.\n\nThe seedlings\u2019 genetic composition indicates that they are a hybrid of the two species of dates known today \u2013 the eastern one, whose habitat stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to India, and the western one, which was found in North Africa. The researchers speculated that these two species first interbred in the Land of Israel.\n\nBut they noted that the older seeds have more eastern DNA. Thus they concluded that the eastern strain was the native species, but that farmers in the Judean Desert may have interbred the two species 2,000 years ago to produce better dates.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Israel archaeology", "Environment & Nature", "Science & Technology", "Dead Sea"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nir Hasson"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Seeds Discovered in the 1960s During Yigal Yadin\u2019s Digs at Masada and Excavations at Qumran", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/static/hdc/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 82903654348, "app_id": 287530407927859}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#0B7EB5", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/hdc/images/mstile-144x144.png", "referrer": "always", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "isPremiumContent": "true", "article": {"content_tier": "free", "published": "2020-02-06T20:25:00+02:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Haaretz.com", "title": "Israeli researchers mate 2,000-year-old date seeds, hope for fruit", "description": "***", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/2020-02-06/ty-article/.premium/israeli-researchers-mate-2-000-year-old-date-seeds-hope-for-fruit/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec87250000", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec751a0000/90/0a/901c9d2c8a165ba94204f87b6a8b/3143764787.jpg?precrop=1835,1067,x258,y254&height=698&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "title": "Israeli Researchers Mate 2,000-year-old Date Seeds, Hope for Fruit - Science", "description": "Seeds Discovered in the 1960s During Yigal Yadin\u2019s Digs at Masada and Excavations at Qumran", "keywords": "Israel archaeology,Environment & Nature,Science & Technology,Dead Sea", "ob": {"title": "Israeli Researchers Mate 2,000-year-old Date Seeds, Hope for Fruit", "pubDate": "06.02.2020 20:25"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@haaretzcom", "title": "Israeli researchers mate 2,000-year-old date seeds, hope for fruit", "description": "***", "image": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec751a0000/90/0a/901c9d2c8a165ba94204f87b6a8b/3143764787.jpg?precrop=1835,1067,x258,y254&height=698&width=1200"}, "publishDate": "2020-02-06T20:25:00+02:00", "canonicalPath": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/2020-02-06/ty-article/.premium/israeli-researchers-mate-2-000-year-old-date-seeds-hope-for-fruit/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec87250000", "news_keywords": "Israel archaeology,Environment & Nature,Science & Technology,Dead Sea", "author": "Nir Hasson", "authorId": "0000017f-da24-d718-a5ff-faa4b8a00000", "articleType": "standardArticle", "cost": 2, "canonical": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/2020-02-06/ty-article/.premium/israeli-researchers-mate-2-000-year-old-date-seeds-hope-for-fruit/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec87250000", "ImageURL": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec751a0000/90/0a/901c9d2c8a165ba94204f87b6a8b/3143764787.jpg?precrop=1835,1067,x258,y254&height=698&width=1200", "SquareImageUrl": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec751a0000/90/0a/901c9d2c8a165ba94204f87b6a8b/3143764787.jpg?precrop=1402,1401,x393,y67&height=200&width=200", "isLockedPush": "false", "next-head-count": 39}, "canonical_link": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/2020-02-06/ty-article/.premium/israeli-researchers-mate-2-000-year-old-date-seeds-hope-for-fruit/0000017f-f8ec-d887-a7ff-f8ec87250000"}
