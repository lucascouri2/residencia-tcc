We are part of that gear that is responsible for the distribution of critical supplies. It is a sign of the need for us, as Argentineans, to stand side by side,\" said FAA Commodore Ricardo Cappabianca, head of the El Palomar Air Brigade.\n\nThe task will continue next week, when the remaining 207 respirators will be distributed to the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Mendoza, Rio Negro, Neuquen, Entre Rios, Santa Cruz, Chubut, La Pampa, San Juan, San Luis, and Tierra del Fuego, and the capital of Buenos Aires.\n\nAs only a few companies in the country are able to produce ventilators, the government made the decision to regulate and centralize the machines' distribution based on the needs of each province, the Ministry of Health told Xinhua.\n\nArgentina reported 4,532 cases of COVID-19, with 229 deaths, as of Saturday morning. \u25a0", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["administration", "buenos aires", "first", "have distributed", "registered", "the distribution", "was first", "supplies", "have been"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A citizen wearing protective gear goes to a supermarket in Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 8, 2020.
