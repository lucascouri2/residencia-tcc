There are currently some 2,500 patients receiving intensive care for coronavirus infections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArcuri spoke of the \u201canguish, with which, each night, we had to decide where to send these instruments, which, in the end, save lives\u201d when there weren\u2019t enough respirators for all those needing them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that with me for all my life, and I wouldn\u2019t wish anyone else to experience\u201d the dilemma of choosing which hospital received them, he said.\n\nFor several days running now in Italy, the number of patients in intensive care wards have been diminishing. Italy has Europe\u2019s highest number of deaths \u2014 more than 24,000 \u2014 in the outbreak, which in the early weeks overwhelmed hospitals, especially in the north where most known cases were registered.\n\nFor more news about the novel coronavirus click here.\n\nWhat you need to know about Coronavirus.\n\nFor more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.\n\nThe Inquirer Foundation supports our healthcare frontliners and is still accepting cash donations to be deposited at Banco de Oro (BDO) current account #007960018860 or donate through PayMaya using this link.\n\nRead Next\n\nMOST READ", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Associated Press"], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 21 19:54:10 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Italy's extraordinary commissioner for the COVID-19 emergency said that for the first time during the pandemic, the nation has more respi...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/icon/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"ttl": 345600, "title": "Italy now has more respirators than ICU patients", "description": "ROME \u2014 Italy&#039;s extraordinary commissioner for the COVID-19 emergency has said that for the first time during the pandemic, the nation has more respirators than patients with coronavirus", "url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1262467/italy-now-has-more-respirators-than-icu-patients", "site_name": "INQUIRER.net", "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2020/04/AP20111592377391-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 175228195865217, "pages": 142802334452}, "article": {"published_time": "Tue, 21 Apr 2020 19:54:10 PST"}, "author": "Associated Press", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Italy's extraordinary commissioner for the COVID-19 emergency said that for the first time during the pandemic, the nation has more respi...", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Italy now has more respirators than ICU patients | Inquirer News", "description": "Italy's extraordinary commissioner for the COVID-19 emergency said that for the first time during the pandemic, the nation has more respi...", "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2020/04/AP20111592377391-scaled.jpg", "creator": "@inquirerdotnet", "site": "@inquirerdotnet", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "kadraneda", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1262467/italy-now-has-more-respirators-than-icu-patients?ia_markup=1"}}, "canonical_link": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1262467/italy-now-has-more-respirators-than-icu-patients"}
