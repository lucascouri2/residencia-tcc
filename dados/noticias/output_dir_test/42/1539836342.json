Much like other awards ceremonies, Spotify will invite some of today\u2019s top artists to perform live on stage. For their first annual ceremony, Spotify is calling upon top Latin pop stars Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Karol G to give performances of some of their hit songs.\n\nAccording to Spotify, their awards will differ from big ceremonies like the Grammys. Rather than a board of directors choosing the winners and nominations, Spotify\u2019s awards will be \u201c100% based on user-generated data.\u201d That means that the awards are based solely on users\u2019 listening stats.\n\nSince the company launched in Mexico in 2013, the capital city has garnered more listeners than any other city globally. In a statement, Managing Director of Spotify Latin America Mia Nygren explained why the company chose Mexico City as their ceremony location. \u201cThanks to streaming and the true audience size of Mexico, users are in the front seat like never before. We decided to celebrate this by recognizing what users love based entirely on their listening. The Spotify Awards is all about this, giving everyone an opportunity to be part of the show.\u201d\n\nSpotify\u2019s first annual awards ceremony takes place tonight at 9 p.m. EST. Spotify Premium users can livestream the awards ceremony here.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["home page", "music", "pop", "bad bunny", "j balvin", "karol g", "spotify", "spotify awards 2020"], "tags": ["J Balvin", "Karol G", "spotify", "Bad Bunny", "Spotify Awards 2020"], "authors": ["Carolyn Droke", "Lexi Lane", "Danielle Chelosky", "Aaron Williams", "Derrick Rossignol", "Assistant Editor", "Indie Mixtape"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar  5 20:48:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The awards ceremony will take place in Mexico City, the streaming capital of the world.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/themes/uproxx/assets/images/tabicon.png", "meta_data": {"description": "The awards ceremony will take place in Mexico City, the streaming capital of the world.", "keywords": "home page, music, pop, bad bunny, j balvin, karol g, spotify, spotify awards 2020", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPROXX", "creator": "@UPROXX", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "Spotify\u2019s First Annual Awards Will Include Performances From Bad Bunny, J Balvin, And Karol G", "text": {"title": "Spotify\u2019s First Annual Awards Will Include Performances From Bad Bunny, J Balvin, And Karol G"}, "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bad-bunny-getty-grid.jpg?w=640"}, "qc": {"post": "spotify-awards-bad-bunny-j-balvin-karol-g", "author": "Carolyn Droke", "section": "music", "primary_tag": "spotify"}, "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bad Bunny, J Balvin, And Karol G Will Perform At Spotify\u2019s First Awards Ceremony", "url": "https://uproxx.com/music/spotify-awards-bad-bunny-j-balvin-karol-g/", "description": "The awards ceremony will take place in Mexico City, the streaming capital of the world.", "site_name": "UPROXX", "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bad-bunny-getty-grid.jpg?w=710", "width": 710, "height": 400}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_GB"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-05T20:48:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-05T20:49:46+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "app_id": 117400151618132, "pages": 116548701336}}, "canonical_link": "https://uproxx.com/music/spotify-awards-bad-bunny-j-balvin-karol-g/"}
