Of course it entered and already caused a death, but its progress has been slow and everyone (the infected) comes from outside contact,\u201d he claimed.\n\nNicaragua, which is reporting nine positive cases of COVID-19 \u2014 including one death \u2014 has not applied strict measures to contain the disease, such as quarantines or border closures.\n\nRather, the government has promoted marches, fairs and sports activities, contrary to the call for social distancing suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nOrtega affirmed that Nicaragua \u201chas the capacity to serve the population as long as the pace at which the epidemic manifests is administered in an orderly manner.\u201d\n\nDuring his appearance Wednesday, Ortega did not announce any new measures to confront COVID-19 and instead took the opportunity to criticize other countries and the global arms race.\n\n\u201cThe world has been scourged with this pandemic,\u201d Ortega said, and neither atomic bombs nor missiles are going to \u201cend the virus.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has killed 130,000 people worldwide, according to the WHO.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign from God, who is telling us that you are going astray by spending billions of dollars on atomic bombs, on military bases and alliances,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cThose transnational forces that are just ambitions for world domination, that is sin, and the Lord is sending us this sign.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Tico Times"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 15 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The latest news and information from Costa Rica including breaking news, weather, travel, events, sports and more.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/16x16favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "The latest news and information from Costa Rica including breaking news, weather, travel, events, sports and more.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ortega insists Nicaragua will not stop activities due to coronavirus", "description": "The latest news and information from Costa Rica including breaking news, weather, travel, events, sports and more.", "url": "https://ticotimes.net/2020/04/15/ortega-insists-nicaragua-will-not-stop-activities-due-to-coronavirus", "site_name": "The Tico Times | Costa Rica News | Travel | Real Estate", "image": {"identifier": "https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/000_1PW4Q8.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 673, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-16T04:32:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-16T04:35:06+00:00"}, "author": "The Tico Times", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TheTicoTimes", "site": "@TheTicoTimes", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "The Tico Times", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.86.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cropped-logo512-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://ticotimes.net/2020/04/15/ortega-insists-nicaragua-will-not-stop-activities-due-to-coronavirus"}
