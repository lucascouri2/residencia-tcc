Mnuchin confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines, SkyWest Airlines and Southwest Airlines intend to participate in the Payroll Support Program.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy and protect taxpayers,\u201d President Trump said at a White House press conference Tuesday. \u201cOur airlines now are in good shape and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them.\u201d\n\nThe airline bailout is part of a government $2.2 trillion economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\n\nAirlines will receive $25 billion in payroll support and another $25 billion in loans will be distributed to passenger airlines and $10 billion in grants and loans will go to cargo airlines and aviation contractors.\n\nAirline who that accept the allotted funds in the package meant for employees are prohibited to make staff or pay cuts Sept. 30, 2020, at which point the airlines hopes demand for travel will be back up.\n\nNegotiations over the bailout became contentious when the Treasury insisted that larger airlines repay at least a portion of the bailout funds through a loan program, according to the New York Times. The final deal establishes that the package will be structured as part grant part loan. Mnuchin told airlines that 30 percent of the assistance would need to be repaid over a period of 10 years.\n\nThe Times noted that the outcome is a major compromise as \u201cairlines were seeking grants with no repayment and the administration preferred loans.\u201d\n\nDavid McNew/Stringer via Getty\n\nAs part of the financial assistance, the Treasury will be able to take stock in airlines that receive the grants.\n\nDelta Air Lines will receive $5.4 billion in direct payroll support, and a $1.6 billion loan, CEO Ed Bastian told employees in a memo on Tuesday. Southwest will receive $3.2 billion, including $2.3 in payroll support and almost $1 billion in loans, according to a press release. American Airlines is slated to receive $5.8 billion as part of the deal, according to The Times, with $4.1 billion coming from payroll support. The airline also plans to request an additional $4.8 billion loan from the Treasury Department.\n\n\u201cThe payroll support program recognizes the extraordinary dedication of our entire team, and importantly, sustains the critical air service being provided by our front-line team members,\u201d Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said in a statement.\n\nhttps://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/us-airlines-bailout-cares-package?did=512840-20200415&utm_campaign=just-in_newsletter&utm_source=travelandleisure.com&utm_medium=email&utm_content=041520&cid=512840&mid=32373469243", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cailey Rizzo", "About Jfp", "Jfpress Provides Local", "State", "National News."], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 17:11:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "US Airlines Will Receive $25 Billion in Federal Aid in Bailout Package - Free Press of Jacksonville", "description": "By Cailey Rizzo \u2013 The funds will protect employee pay through Sept. 30, 2020.
