All these organisations say that SA is doing quite a good job in protecting our people against this virus because it indeed kills,\" said Mthembu.He said the message that is being spread around the world is for people to stay at home.\"Now, how would that be worse than apartheid? I have no idea ... we need to take all measure available to us to save lives,\" said Mthembu.He said when people go out of their homes, they come into contact with the disease and take it back to their homes.Zulu also slammed the comparison of the lockdown measures with apartheid.\"As for the ones that say we have passed regulations that are draconian, I think those who said that have never lived under apartheid.\"Those who have lived under apartheid know what I am speaking about. We have not introduced draconian laws yet because we trust that the people of SA know the crisis we are in,\" said Zulu.She said the majority of South Africans are obeying the lockdown regulations because they want to protect themselves against the virus.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bulawayo24", "BYO24", "Bulawayo24 News", "Todays news", "breaking news", "latest news", "news latest breaking stories", "online news", "world news", "Bulawayo news", "Zimbabwe news", "Africa news", "local news", "celebrity news", "todays sport news", "todays travel news", "", "sa", "lockdown", "ramaphosa"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Staf Reporter"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The government has slammed critics who have likened the national lockdown to measures under apartheid rule.Addressing the media on Saturday, ministers who are p...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "iphone_icon.jpg", "meta_data": {"Author": "eDuzeNet", "robots": "all", "resource-type": "document", "distribution": "Global", "rating": "General", "msvalidate.01": "022CA9F485832A68C49511254B5E2466", "fb": {"app_id": 200461333325113, "pages": 128990327163597}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Ramaphosa's lockdown regulations likened to apartheid era", "type": "Article", "url": "https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-182120.html", "site_name": "Bulawayo24 News", "locale": "en_GB", "article": {"author": "Bulawayo24 News", "section": "Zimbabwe"}, "image": "https://img.bulawayo24.com/articles/bulawayo24.png", "description": "The government has slammed critics who have likened the national lockdown to measures under apartheid rule.Addressing the media on Saturday, ministers who are p..."}, "description": "The government has slammed critics who have likened the national lockdown to measures under apartheid rule.Addressing the media on Saturday, ministers who are p...", "keywords": "Bulawayo24,BYO24, Bulawayo24 News, Todays news,breaking news,latest news,news latest breaking stories, online news, world news,Bulawayo news,Zimbabwe news,Africa news, local news, celebrity news, todays sport news, todays travel news,,sa,lockdown,ramaphosa", "google-site-verification": "7dyL_hKmJUcDF4ivApjDahyb2GEVzOzr3dAT35fYuaE"}, "canonical_link": "https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-182120.html"}
