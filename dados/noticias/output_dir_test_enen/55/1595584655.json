CT scan footage revealed a line-shaped infection in the man\u2019s lungs. Paragonimiasis can be contracted from the consumption of unclean water containing tapeworms. Given that Wang ate raw seafood, he might have been infected by pathogens from such food.\n\nLine shaped infection in Wang\u2019s lungs (Photo Credits: Daily Mail)\n\nWhen the doctors asked about his dietary habits, Mr Wang said that he enjoyed having seafood, such as crayfish and river snails. He also confessed that he even gobbled down a raw snake gallbladder once before.\n\nWet Markets in China\n\nGenerally, wet markets refer to the markets that sell fresh meat, fish, etc, but in China, these markets are known to sell the meat of wild animals, which are known sources of several deadly pathogens like the Wuhan Coronavirus. The scientific reports suggest that a 55-year-old woman from China\u2019s Hubei province may have been the first person to have contracted COVID-19 through one such wet market.\n\nHuanan Seafood Market in China\u2019s Wuhan is believed to be the epicentre of coronavirus. Earlier, the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations to act against China\u2019s wet markets.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["chinese food", "China", "coronavirus", "infection", "Chinese virus", "food"], "authors": ["Opindia Staff", "Https", "Staff Reporter At Opindia"], "publish_date": "Sun May  3 10:31:29 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Chinese man visited a doctor after experiencing breathing difficulties, only to find that his lungs were infested with live worms.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/opindia-logo-300x300.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Chinese man visited a doctor after experiencing breathing difficulties, only to find that his lungs were infested with live worms.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Chinese man detected with worms in lungs after eating raw seafood", "description": "The Chinese man visited a doctor after experiencing breathing difficulties, only to find that his lungs were infested with live worms.", "url": "http://www.opindia.com/2020/05/china-man-who-ate-raw-snake-gallbladder-and-raw-seafood-finds-out-that-his-lungs-are-filled-with-worms/", "site_name": "OpIndia", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Opindia-Images-4-1.jpg?fit=700%2C400&ssl=1", "width": 700, "height": 400}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/opindiacom/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/opindiacom/", "published_time": "2020-05-03T10:31:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-03T11:01:58+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1805721903042784, "pages": 1562929943918762}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/opindia_com", "site": "@OpIndia_com"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.opindia.com/2020/05/china-man-who-ate-raw-snake-gallbladder-and-raw-seafood-finds-out-that-his-lungs-are-filled-with-worms/?ia_markup=1"}, "theme-color": "#333333", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cropped-opindia-logo-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.opindia.com/2020/05/china-man-who-ate-raw-snake-gallbladder-and-raw-seafood-finds-out-that-his-lungs-are-filled-with-worms/"}
