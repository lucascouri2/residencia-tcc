Supreme Court, with the justice ruling against the Huawei executive on the issue of double criminality.\r\n\r\nShe must now remain in B.C. as the legal battle against her continues, with court dates set through the summer.\r\n\r\nMeng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December of 2018 at the request of the Americans, who had charged her with fraud over allegations she violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/martinmacmahon\/status\/1265704829898219520\r\n\r\nCanada didn't have the same sanctions when the U.S. claims Meng duped financial institutions into doing business with an Iranian subsidiary. So, even though she and Huawei both deny the claims, Meng's legal team had argued even if she had done what the Americans claim she did, it wouldn't lead to a trial in this country.\r\n\r\nHowever, Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes dismissed the application, finding the requirement for double criminality can be met.\r\n\r\n\"Under extradition law, an individual may only be extradited to face trial on foreign charges (in this case, the US) where the underlying conduct, had it been committed in Canada, would also amount to a criminal offence in Canada,\" a statement from the Department of Justice reads.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/GS_Harper\/status\/1265713270473687040\r\n\r\nIt adds another hearing will take place.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a setback in Meng's bid to avoid extradition, her lawyers still have further options. They plan to argue her rights were violated during her arrest more than a year ago.\r\n\r\nHuawei says it is disappointed in the decision by the court, once again saying it believes\u00a0Canada's justice system will eventually prove her innocence.\r\n\r\n\"We have repeatedly expressed confidence in Ms. Meng's innocence. Huawei continues to stand with Ms. Meng in her pursuit for justice and freedom,\" reads a release from the company.\r\n\r\nIt also says her lawyers will continue to make sure her name is cleared.\r\n\r\nOne of the big implications of this legal battle is the fate of two Canadians still in custody in China. The detentions of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have widely been seen as retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest.\r\n\r\nThe B.C. Supreme Court ruling foreshadows the \"worst-ever\" China-Canada ties, Zhi Zhenfeng, a legal expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Chinese state-owned newspaper <em>Global Times<\/em>.\r\n\r\nHe called the ruling \"unjustified,\" and said the case will now proceed to the next phase.\r\n\r\n\"The local court still needs to hear appeals such as whether the Canadian officials detained Meng for substantive reasons and based on the legal process.\" Zhi said.\r\n\r\nMeng is now due back in court on June 15.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>-With files from Ria Renouf<\/strong><\/em>","post_title":"B.C.

Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d that guides users to a Twitter \u201cmoments\u201d page with fact checks and news stories about Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims.\r\n\r\nTrump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d and insisting that \u201cas president, I will not allow this to happen.\u201d His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter\u2019s \u201cclear political bias\u201d had led the campaign to pull \u201call our advertising from Twitter months ago.\u201d Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/1265427538140188676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1265427538140188676&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Fc8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001\r\n\r\nTrump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.\r\n\r\nBut some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \u201cplatforms\u201d under federal law \u2014 or be treated more like publishers, which could face lawsuits over content.\r\n\r\nThe protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\u201cBig tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\u201d Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. \u201cThey get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that\u2019s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.\u201d\r\n\r\n<!-- Byline, Source -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Photo: DCEV366-526_2020_212133.jpg, Caption: President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes in the Rose Garden White House, Tuesday, May 26, 2020, in Washington.

Supreme Court ruled that allegations against Meng Wanzhou could constitute a crime in Canada, setting the stage for legal proceedings to continue.\r\n\r\n\"On the question of law posed, I conclude that, as a matter of law, the double criminality requirement for extradition is capable of being met in this case,\" she told the court.\r\n\r\nHolmes read aloud a small portion of her written decision in court as Meng watched with her lawyers.\r\n\r\nThe ruling means the court will continue to hear other arguments in the extradition case, including whether Meng's arrest at the Vancouver airport in December 2018 was unlawful.\r\n\r\nIt also means Meng, 48, will not be permitted to return to China and must remain in Canada. If Holmes rules in Meng's favour at any step in the hearings, it would set the stage for her release.\r\n\r\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic uproar. Beijing has detained two Canadians _ Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor_ and restricted some imports in moves widely viewed as retaliation.\r\n\r\nThe allegations against Meng, who is Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, date back to 2013.\r\n\r\nShe is accused of making false statements to HSBC, significantly understating Huawei's relationship with Iranian subsidiary Skycom Tech Co., and putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\r\n\r\nMeng and Huawei have denied all the allegations levelled against them.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, Huawei expressed its disappointment in the decision.\r\n\r\n\"Huawei continues to stand with Ms. Meng in her pursuit for justice and freedom,\" it says.\r\n\r\n\"We expect that Canada's judicial system will ultimately prove Ms. Meng's innocence.\"\r\n\r\nIn January, Holmes heard arguments in the case related to the issue of so-called double criminality, or whether the alleged crime would have also been considered criminal if it took place in Canada.\r\n\r\nHer lawyers argued that the conduct could not have amounted to fraud in Canada because it relates entirely to the effects of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. At the time, Canada had no such sanctions, just as it has none now, they said.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General of Canada told the court that the fraud allegations could be argued without reference to U.S. sanctions.\r\n\r\nIn her written decision, Holmes says the allegations do depend on the effects of U.S. sanctions but that's not enough to dismiss the case.\r\n\r\n\"I conclude that those effects may play a part in the determination of whether double criminality is established,\" she says.\r\n\r\nWhile she found the U.S. sanctions are not an \"intrinsic\" part of the alleged conduct, they explain how HSBC was at risk of violating them.\r\n\r\n\"For this reason, I cannot agree with Ms. Meng that to refer to U.S. sanctions in order to understand the risk to HSBC is to allow the essence of the conduct to be defined by foreign law. Canada's laws determine whether the alleged conduct, in its essence, amounts to fraud.\"\r\n\r\nOn that issue, Holmes says Meng's lawyers applied an \"artificially narrow scope\" to the definition of fraud within the context of extradition.\r\n\r\n\"The offence of fraud has a vast potential scope,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe defence's approach to the double-criminality analysis would also \"seriously limit Canada's ability to fulfill its international obligations in the extradition context for fraud and other economic crimes,\" she says.\r\n\r\nHolmes says that because it's OK to consider the sanctions as part of the legal analysis, she is dismissing Meng's application.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Holmes says she would not rule on the \"larger question\" of whether there is enough evidence admissible under the Extradition Act that Meng's alleged conduct would justify her committal for trial in Canada on the offence of fraud.\r\n\r\n\"This question will be determined at a later stage in the proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nA crowd outside the court included a group of protesters who chanted \"No Huawei in Canada\" and \"Free the two Michaels\" in a reference to Kovrig and Spavor.\r\n\r\nOne of the protesters, Louis Huang, said he is among a group of immigrants from China who have been at the court pushing the Chinese government to release the two Canadians.\r\n\r\n\"They're using these innocent people, Canadians, to bargain,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe next phase of the legal process will consider defence claims that Canada Border Services, the RCMP and the Federal Bureau of Investigation violated Meng's rights while collecting evidence before her arrest.\r\n\r\nHer lawyers have alleged in court that the agencies conducted a \"covert criminal investigation\" when she was arrested at the Vancouver airport and violated her charter rights.\r\n\r\nThe Crown has said officials followed the law when Meng was detained and there's no proof that she was illegally arrested.\r\n\r\nBorder officers seized Meng's cellphones, tablet and other devices and wrote down her passcodes, which were handed to RCMP when she was arrested.\r\n\r\nThe Crown has told the court that when the border agency learned of its mistake it told the RCMP that the codes couldn't be used or shared because they were obtained during the agency's examination.\r\n\r\nBoth sides return to court next Wednesday for a case management conference.\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne tweeted a statement after Wednesday's court decision calling for the release of Kovrig and Spavor, saying they have been \"arbitrarily detained for over 500 days.\"\r\n\r\nHe also asked the Chinese government to intervene in the case of Robert Schellenberg, a man from British Columbia who is facing the death penalty for drug trafficking.\r\n\r\n\"We will continue to advocate for their immediate release and seek clemency for Canadians facing the death penalty in China, including Robert Schellenberg,\" he says.\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described Meng's arrest as political and warned of consequences if she is not released.\r\n\r\n\"The Canadian side should immediately correct its mistake, release Ms. Meng and ensure her safe return to China at an early date so as to avoid any continuous harm to China-Canada relations,\" Zhao said in a transcription published online by the ministry.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Justice Department thanked Canada on Wednesday for its continuing assistance in the Meng case, and Champagne reiterated that Canada's judiciary operates independently. \r\n","post_title":"Judge rules Huawei CFO Meng's fraud case will proceed","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"judge-rules-huawei-cfo-mengs-fraud-case-will-proceed","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-05-27 22:31:11","post_modified_gmt":"2020-05-28 02:31:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/toronto.citynews.ca\/?p=2247986","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","permalink":"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/2020\/05\/27\/judge-rules-huawei-cfo-mengs-fraud-case-will-proceed\/","post_title_shortened":"Judge rules Huawei CFO Meng's fraud case will proceed","post_thumbnail":"<img width=\"127\" height=\"71\" src=\"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/wp-content\/themes\/samuel\/images\/transparent.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/sites\/19\/2020\/05\/JFJ50564854-310x174.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-infinite-scroll wp-post-image\" alt=\"\">"}]};

        	<p>OTTAWA (NEWS 1130) — In what the prime minister is calling &#8220;extremely troubling,&#8221; a military report accuses several Ontario long-term care homes of negligence and appalling conditions for people living there.</p>
<p>The report details first-hand accounts of cockroach infestations, patients crying for help while staff stood idle, residents not being bathed for weeks and being forcefully fed, and COVID-19 patients allowed to wander freely.</p>
<p>“There are things in there that are extremely troubling,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. “We need to take action.”</p>
<p>The military was deployed to nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec to reinforce workers overwhelmed by the pandemic, unable to keep up with residents’ needs because of all the protective measures they need to take, or off work because they’re ill themselves.</p>
<p>To date, 36 members of the Canadian Forces have come down with COVID-19 while working, up from 28 cases less than a week ago. Fourteen of the military members with COVID-19 are in Ontario and 22 are in Quebec.</p>
<p>Trudeau said the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have both asked for the military to extend the deployment and he expects to agree. The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in both provinces, Trudeau announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Over the last few weeks, our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians, as we deal with this pandemic. And as the need for their help continues, we’ve received new requests to extend this period of deployment in both Ontario and Quebec. We will be following up,” he said.</p>

<p>Trudeau said he spoke to Ontario Premier Doug Ford earlier in the morning and assured him the federal government will be there to support the province.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need to do a better job of taking care of our elders in long-term care facilities in Ontario and, indeed, right across the country,&#8221; Trudeau said.</p>
<p>He also said that the problems uncovered by the military go beyond the facilities were members were stationed in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many, extraordinary, excellent long-term care facilities across this country,&#8221; Trudeau added. &#8220;There are some that, obviously, are not doing as well, that we need to make sure we are improving the standards of care.&#8221;</p>
