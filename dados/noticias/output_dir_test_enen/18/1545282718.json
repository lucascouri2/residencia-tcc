Bernie Sanders (I-VT) vowed Wednesday to stay in the 2020 Democratic presidential race despite a dismal showing in key states Tuesday night, adding that he \u201clooks forward\u201d to debating former Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday.\n\n\u201cLast night, obviously, was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,\u201d Sanders told reporters in a brief address from Burlington, Vermont. \u201cWe lost in the largest state up for grabs yesterday, the state of Michigan. We lost in Mississippi, Missouri, and Idaho.\u201d\n\nBiden decisive primary victories in Michigan, Missouri, Idaho and Mississippi Tuesday night helped expand his delegate lead to 160. As of Wednesday morning before the news conference, Biden was leading Sanders in the delegate count 857 to 709.\n\nTrending: Super Tuesday 2 State-by-State Results\n\nSanders acknowledged that his campaign is \u201closing the debate over electability\u201d because they \u201cDemocrats and independents today believe\u201d Biden is best equipped to defeat President Trump in November.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nWill the Democrats Allow Bernie to get Democrat Nomination?

I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \u201cI like what your campaign stands for. I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have heard that statement all over this country. Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion, but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.\u201d\n\nHe took a swipe at the democratic establishment, warning that nominating a candidate that fails to win the millennial voters could hurt their chances in the general election and beyond.\n\n\u201cToday I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhile Joe Biden continues to do very well with older Americans, especially those people over 65, our campaign continues to win the vast majority of the votes of younger people and I am talking about people not just in their 20s, but in their 30s and their 40s, the younger generations of this country continue, in very strong numbers, to support our campaign.\u201d\n\nSanders previewed a list of policy questions he plans to ask Biden at Sunday\u2019s debate in Phoenix, including on health care costs and his signature \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal.\n\n\u201cLet me be very frank as to the questions that I will be asking Joe,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cJoe, what are you going to do for the 500,000 people who go bankrupt in our country because of medically related debt? And what are you going to do for the working people of this country and small business people who are paying on average 20 percent of their incomes to health care?\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Socialist Senator will debate Biden one-on-one for the first time in the presidential race. He stated the debate hosted by CNN will show voters between the two candidate who is best equipped to beat Trump.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen. On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal,\u201d Sanders concluded, leaving the podium without taking any questions from reporters.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Follow Hispolitica On"], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 11 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Sen.
