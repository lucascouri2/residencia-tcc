I hope it did, anyway.\"\n\nHanson said the community has been very supportive of the residents and staff, with businesses and community members dropping off various donations, such as masks, activities, and snacks.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["good shepherd care center", "good shepherdgood shepherd health center", "pet parade", "animal parade", "covid 19"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Lisa Grouette Lisa.Grouette Globegazette.Com", "Lisa Grouette"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Goats, cats, and all sizes of dogs strutted their stuff for the residents of Good Shepherd Health Center and Cornerstone Assisted Living on Friday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://globegazette.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "good shepherd care center, good shepherdgood shepherd health center, pet parade, animal parade, covid 19", "news_keywords": "good shepherd care center, good shepherdgood shepherd health center, pet parade, animal parade, covid 19", "description": "Goats, cats, and all sizes of dogs strutted their stuff for the residents of Good Shepherd Health Center and Cornerstone Assisted Living on Friday.", "author": "LISA GROUETTE lisa.grouette@globegazette.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=437581408", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.globegazette.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "_As_f7gitKA5YkXZrMgIu7WOs7h0VYaavTdsfzPzaXk", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://globegazette.com/community/watch-now-pets-put-on-their-sunday-best-for-senior-living-residents/article_31e822ad-c511-5060-8417-a5d646887579.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/globegazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/bd/bbda3774-1648-5609-ac31-80aa83fd6df5/5ebf142d53093.image.jpg?crop=1720%2C968%2C0%2C118&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 1120, "height": 630}, "title": "WATCH NOW: Pets put on their Sunday best for senior living residents", "description": "Goats, cats, and all sizes of dogs strutted their stuff for the residents of Good Shepherd Health Center and Cornerstone Assisted Living on Friday.", "site_name": "Globe Gazette | Mason City, Iowa | globegazette.com", "section": "Community"}, "fb": {"pages": 289040351411}, "parsely-title": "WATCH NOW: Pets put on their Sunday best for senior living residents", "parsely-link": "https://globegazette.com/community/watch-now-pets-put-on-their-sunday-best-for-senior-living-residents/article_31e822ad-c511-5060-8417-a5d646887579.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-05-15T17:30:00-0500", "parsely-post-id": "31e822ad-c511-5060-8417-a5d646887579", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/globegazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/bd/bbda3774-1648-5609-ac31-80aa83fd6df5/5ebf142d53093.image.jpg?crop=1720%2C968%2C0%2C118&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-author": "Lisa Grouette", "parsely-section": "Community", "parsely-tags": "good shepherd care center, good shepherdgood shepherd health center, pet parade, animal parade, covid 19, alert, featured"}, "canonical_link": "https://globegazette.com/community/watch-now-pets-put-on-their-sunday-best-for-senior-living-residents/article_31e822ad-c511-5060-8417-a5d646887579.html"}
