Those who move sessions court and their plea is rejected can appeal before HC.The matter came up before a larger bench after reference by a single judge, disagreeing with the judgment passed in the case of one Vinod Kumar.The five-judge bench was of view that \u201cwe would consequently answer the reference by holding that the decision in the Vinod Kumar case does not merit reconsideration or explanation. There can be no exhaustive exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly. The court would err in attempting to draw a uniform code ordictum that may guide the exercise of discretion vested in the court. The discretion left unfettered by the legislature must be recognised. The contingencies spelled out in Vinod Kumar case as illustrative of special circumstances may, where duly established, constitute the ground to petition high court directly.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Allahabad news", "Allahabad latest news", "Allahabad news live", "Allahabad news today", "Today news Allahabad", "Yashwant Verma", "Ramesh Sinha", "Rahul Chaturvedi", "Govind Mathur", "Allahabad HC"], "tags": ["Shiv Sena", "Yashwant Verma", "Bangalore Rains", "Mumbai Floods", "Chennai Rains", "Ramesh Sinha", "Delhi Pollution", "Allahabad HC", "Aditya Thackeray", "Coronavirus in Delhi", "Delhi Earthquake", "Srinagar encounter", "Rahul Chaturvedi", "Coronavirus in Telangana", "Madras High Court", "Mumbai Rains", "Govind Mathur", "Fire in Mumbai"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "keywords": "Allahabad news, Allahabad latest news, Allahabad news live, Allahabad news today, Today news Allahabad,Yashwant Verma,Ramesh Sinha,Rahul Chaturvedi,Govind Mathur,Allahabad HC", "og": {"title": "'Petitioners can directly move high court for anticipatory bail' | Allahabad News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74469878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228395,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74469878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228395,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "'Petitioners can directly move high court for anticipatory bail' | Allahabad News - Times of India", "description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms"}
