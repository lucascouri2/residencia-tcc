Duchin said he felt confident saying the rate of transmission is lower than it was, but he wouldn\u2019t put much stock in the precise figure.\n\nTo see a drop in the number of new cases, the measure of transmission would have to be below 1.\n\nThere are now more than 4,850 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washington state and at least 195 deaths, as of Sunday, March 29.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in several weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", "coronavirus"], "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 30 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Public health officials and researchers say social distancing appears to be helping slow the spread of COVID-19 in King County.
